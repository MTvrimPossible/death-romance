I'll make death love me, for I will contend
Even with his pestilent scythe.

[]

Remember, if your parachute fails to open there's no reason to panic. You have the rest of your life to troubleshoot the problem.

[]

My abyss speaks, I have unfolded my ultimate depth to the light!
Hail to me! Here now! Give me your hand–ha! Let go! Haha! –Nausea, nausea, nausea–oh no!

[]

I, Zarathustra, the advocate of life, the advocate of suffering, the advocate of the circle – you I summon, my most abysmal thought!
Hail to me! You are coming – I hear you! 

[]

The eternal hourglass of existencfe is turned over again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!

[]

What has been will be again,
what has been done will be done again;
there is nothing new under the sun.

[]

All things are impermanent in nature.

[]

In infinite time, in infinite matter, in infinite space, is formed a bubble-organism, and that bubble lasts a while and bursts, and that bubble is me.

[]

Something offered is not offered. Something finished is not finished. Nothing changes.

[]

It is wiser to contemplate the law of impermanence than to try to repeal it.

[]

Whatever
is
will be
was

[]

I’m sorry for people who make a great to-do about the transitory nature of things and get lost in meditations of earthly nothingness. Surely we are here precisely so as to turn what passes into something that endures; but this is possible only if you can appreciate both.

[]

Everything passes, everything perishes, everything palls.

[]

Knowledge of the stability of the Dhamma is also subject to destruction, vanishing, fading away and cessation.

[]

Philip, remember that thou art mortal.

[]

It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: "And this, too, shall pass away". How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride!—how consoling in the depth of affliction!

[]

So fleet the works of men, back to their earth again;
Ancient and holy things fade like a dream.

[]

Faded the flower and all its budded charms,
Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes,
Faded the shape of beauty from my arms,
Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradise!
Vanish'd unseasonably...

[]

Don't strew me with roses after I'm dead.
When Death claims the light of my brow,
No flowers of life will cheer me: instead
You may give me my roses now!

[]

The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

[]

I wrote my name upon the sand,
And trusted it would stand for aye;
But, soon, alas! the refluent sea
Had washed my feeble lines away.

[]

The immortal could we cease to contemplate,
The mortal part suggests its every trait.
God laid His fingers on the ivories
Of her pure members as on smoothèd keys,
And there out-breathed her spirit's harmonies.

[]

This is the spot where I am mortal.

[]

Consider
The lilies of the field whose bloom is brief:—
We are as they;
Like them we fade away
As doth a leaf.

[]

That flesh is but the glasse, which holds the dust
That measures all our time; which also shall
Be crumbled into dust.

[]

"O Charidas, what of the underworld?"
"Great darkness."
"And what of the resurrection?"
"A lie."
"And Pluto?"
"A fable; we perish utterly."

[]

Mortality is man's invention; not in the logic of life.

[]

Memento mori.

[]

You must drink quickly as from a rapid stream that will not always flow.

[]

It's our mortality that defines us, Soran. It's part of the truth of our existence.

[]

To smell to a turf of fresh earth is wholesome for the body; no less are thoughts of mortality cordial to the soul.

[]

To go from mortal to Buddha, you have to put an end to karma, nurture your awareness, and accept what life brings.

[]

Knowledge by suffering entereth,
And Life is perfected by Death.

[]

To the ears of one possessed by the God of Death, reason and objections seem like so many idle complaints.

[]

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied oh why ask me
That suicide is painless
It brings so many changes
And I can take or leave them if I please

[]

Pain is temporary, glory is forever.

[]

Pain is universal. We all experience pain, loss, and death the same way.

[]

Let a disciple live as Christ lived, and he will easily believe in living again as Christ does.

[]

Though inland far we be,
Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
Which brought us hither.

[]

Man is immortal till his work is done.

[]

Go on and increase in valor, O boy! this is the path to immortality.

[]

There is something beyond the grave; death does not put an end to everything, the dark shade escapes from the consumed pile.

[]

'Tis true; 'tis certain; man though dead retains
Part of himself; the immortal mind remains.

[]

Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

[]

No one could ever meet death for his country without the hope of immortality

[]

'Tis immortality to die aspiring,
As if a man were taken quick to heaven.

[]

A good man never dies.

[]

Fish say, they have their Stream and Pond;
But is there anything Beyond?

[]

On the cold cheek of Death smiles and roses are blending,
And beauty immortal awakes from the tomb.

[]

'Tis immortality, 'tis that alone,
Amid life's pains, abasements, emptiness,
The soul can comfort, elevate, and fill.
That only, and that amply this performs.

[]

An angel's arm can't snatch me from the grave;
Legions of angels can't confine me there.

[]

A man really and practically looking onwards to an immortal life, on whatever grounds, exhibits to us the human soul in an enobled attitude.

[]

Immortal, my arse. That’s just an error of parallax.

[]

The human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the body, but something of it remains which is eternal.... We feel and know by experience that we are eternal.

[]

It And her immortal part with angels lives.

[]

I hold it ever,
Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs
May the two latter darken and expend;
But immortality attends the former,
Making a man a god.

[]

Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight tomorrow
Thou must be made immortal.

[]

Death must be an evil—and the gods agree;
for why else would they live for ever?

[]

Whatever is always in motion is immortal.

[]

What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal.

[]

Without a belief in personal immortality, religion surely is like an arch resting on one pillar, like a bridge ending in an abyss.

[]

For spirits that live throughout
Vital in every part, not as frail man,
In entrails, heart or head, liver or reins,
Cannot but by annihilating die.

[]

They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet
Quaff immortality and joy.

[]

And in the wreck of noble lives
Something immortal still survives.

[]

Immortality is the only thing which doesn't tolerate being postponed.

[]

I long to believe in immortality. I shall never be able to bid you an entire farewell. If I am destined to be happy with you here—how short is the longest life. I wish to believe in immortality—I wish to live with you forever.

[]

No, no, I'm sure,
My restless spirit never could endure
To brood so long upon one luxury,
Unless it did, though fearfully, espy
A hope beyond the shadow of a dream.

[]

He ne'er is crowned with immortality
Who fears to follow where airy voices lead.

[]

Why was I born if it wasn't forever?

[]

He had decided to live forever or die in the attempt.

[]

No young man believes he shall ever die.

[]

Millions long for immortality who do not know what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon.

[]

IMMORTAL is an ample word
When what we need is by,
but when it leaves us for a time,
’T is a necessity.

[]

All worldly shapes shall melt in gloom,
The sun himself must die,
Before this mortal shall assume
Its immortality.

[]

I will have nothing to do with your immortality; we are miserable enough in this life, without the absurdity of speculating upon another.

[]

That which is the foundation of all our hopes and of all our fears; all our hopes and fears which are of any consideration: I mean a Future Life.

[]

Nothing is lasting but change; nothing perpetual but death.

[]

A toy which people cry for,
And on their knees apply for,
Dispute, contend and lie for,
And if allowed
Would be right proud
Eternally to die for.

[]

Clov: Do you believe in the life to come? Hamm: Mine was always that.

[]

Oh Gilgamec! Enlil, the Great Mountain, the father of gods, has made kingship your destiny, but not eternal life.

[]

The stars shall fade away, the sun himself
Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years,
But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,
Unhurt amidst the wars of elements,
The wrecks of matter, and the crush of worlds.

[]

Hail Cæsar, we who are about to die salute you.

[]

Be happy while you're living,
For you're a long time dead.

[]

Xerxes the great did die;
And so must you and I.

[]

The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.

[]

Oh, stanch my bootless tears, my weeping is in vain;
I am not lost, for we in heaven shall one day meet again.

[]

And the intoxication of death will bring the truth; that is what you were trying to avoid.

[]

And We did not give immortality to any human that came before you. If you are going to die, would they be immortal? every soul will taste death. And We burden you with evil and good as a test, and it is to Us that you will return.

[]

Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your (full) compensation on the Day of Resurrection. So he who is drawn away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has attained (his desire). And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion.

[]

And no soul can die except by God's permission—the term is fixed. And whoever desires the reward of this world, We give him of it, and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We give him of it. And We shall reward the grateful.

[]

I have said ye are gods … But ye shall die like men.

[]

There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.

[]

Death is swallowed up in victory. O Death where is thy sting, O Grave where is thy victory?

[]

For he must rule as king until God has put all enemies under his feet. And the last enemy, death, is to be brought to nothing.

[]

The axe is laid unto the root of the trees.

[]

I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.

[]

And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in Hell.

[]

The land of darkness and the shadow of death.

[]

He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.

[]

The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.

[]

And those slain by Jehovah in that day will be from one end of the earth clear to the other end of the earth. They will not be mourned, nor will they be gathered up or buried. They will become like manure on the surface of the ground.

[]

We all do fade as a leaf.

[]

For dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return.

[]

Judge none blessed before his death.

[]

Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might, for there is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave, where you are going.

[]

For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all, nor do they have any more reward, because all memory of them is forgotten.

[]

The grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets.

[]

One event happeneth to them all.

[]

I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees.

[]

Men drop so fast, ere life's mid stage we tread,
Few know so many friends alive, as dead.

[]

Death loves a shining mark, a signal blow.

[]

Early, bright, transient, chaste, as morning dew
She sparkled, was exhal'd, and went to heaven.

[]

As soon as man, expert from time, has found
The key of life, it opes the gates of death.

[]

And feels a thousand deaths, in fearing one.

[]

The knell, the shroud, the mattock and the grave,
The deep, damp vault, the darkness, and the worm.

[]

Death is the crown of life;
Were death denyed, poor man would live in vain;
Were death denyed, to live would not be life;
Were death denyed, ev'n fools would wish to die.

[]

Lovely in death the beauteous ruin lay;
And if in death still lovely, lovelier there;
Far lovelier! pity swells the tide of love.

[]

A death-bed's a detector of the heart.

[]

The chamber where the good man meets his fate
Is privileged beyond the common walk
Of virtuous life, quite in the verge of heaven.

[]

Who can take
Death's portrait? The tyrant never sat.

[]

Insatiate archer! could not one suffice?
Thy shaft flew thrice; and thrice my peace was slain!

[]

People don't die that easily, really. ...As long as they've got something worth living for.

[]

He first deceased; she for a little tried
To live without him, lik'd it not, and died.

[]

"But they are dead; those two are dead!
Their spirits are in Heaven!"
'Twas throwing words away; for still
The little Maid would have her will,
And said, "Nay, we are seven!"

[]

Burn to the socket.

[]

Death is the quiet haven of us all.

[]

O, sir! the good die first,
And they whose hearts are dry as summer dust
Burn to the socket.

[]

But he lay like a warrior taking his rest,
With his martial cloak around him.

[]

I don't wanna die
But I ain't keen on living either

[]

How beautiful it is for a man to die
Upon the walls of Zion! to be called
Like a watch-worn and weary sentinel,
To put his armour off, and rest in heaven!

[]

It is not the fear of death
That damps my brow;
It is not for another breath
I ask thee now;
I could die with a lip unstirred.

[]

Death is nature's way of saying, "Your table is ready."

[]

Nothing can happen more beautiful than death.

[]

O, I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me, as day cannot,
I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.

[]

Joy, shipmate, joy
(Pleas'd to my soul at death I cry,)
Our life is closed, our life begins,
The long, long anchorage we leave,
The ship is clear at last, she leaps!
Joy, shipmate, joy!

[]

Like Moses to thyself convey,
And kiss my raptur'd soul away.

[]

I rejoice in the presence of death because I think it’s what makes life brilliant and beautiful. And without it, the world would be ridiculous. I’m interested in it from every point of view. My interest in it has not dimmed with its approach.

[]

I saw him now going the way of all flesh.

[]

I know death hath ten thousand several doors
For men to take their exits.

[]

One may live as a conqueror, a king, or a magistrate; but he must die as a man.

[]

The tall, the wise, the reverend head,
Must lie as low as ours.

[]

Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound.

[]

But God, who is able to prevail, wrestled with him, as the angel did with Jacob, and marked him; marked him for his own.

[]

Softly his fainting head he lay
Upon his Maker's breast;
His Maker kiss'd his soul away,
And laid his flesh to rest.

[]

Every man dies. Not every man really lives.

[]

Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.

[]

It is vain for the coward to flee; death follows close behind; it is only by defying it that the brave escape.

[]

It is today, my dear, that I take a perilous leap.

[]

It becomes an emperor to die standing.

[]

Is it then so sad a thing to die?

[]

The wave from which there is no return.

[]

I have lived, and I have run the course which fortune allotted me; and now my shade shall descend illustrious to the grave.

[]

The supreme day has come and the inevitable hour.

[]

No one says in the morning: A day is soon past, let us wait for the night. ...Yet what we cannot be certain of for an hour, we sometimes feel assured of for life, and say: “If death is the end of everything, why give ourselves so much trouble?"

[]

Only the feeble resign themselves to final death and substitute some other desire for the longing for personal immortality. In the strong the zeal for perpetuity overrides the doubt of realizing it, and their superabundance of life overflows upon the other side of death.

[]

And God said, "A way must be conceived to pursue the dead beyond the tomb."

[]

Say the report is exaggerated.

[]

Death is so preoccupied with life, that is has no time for anything else.

[]

So what if a kid dies? God will take care of him.

[]

Our soul’s perfection is our life’s purpose; any other purpose, keeping death in mind, has no substance.

[]

Those who are lighthearted remind me of death.

[]

Death is a stripping away of all that is not you. The secret of life is to "die before you die" - and find that there is no death.

[]

Since every day a little of our life is taken from us—since we are dying every day—the final hour when we cease to exist does not of itself bring death; it merely completes the death process.

[]

These taught us how to live; and (oh, too high
The price for knowledge!) taught us how to die.

[]

I hear a voice you cannot hear,
Which says, I must not stay;
I see a hand you cannot see,
Which beckons me away.

[]

And at departure he will say, "Mayest thou rest soundly and quietly, and may the light turf lie easy on thy bones."

[]

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

[]

While there's life there’s hope, and only the dead have none.

[]

Dead men bite not.

[]

Whatever crazy sorrow saith,
No life that breathes with human breath
Has ever truly long'd for death.

[]

The night comes on that knows not morn,
When I shall cease to be all alone,
To live forgotten, and love forlorn.

[]

For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far,
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.

[]

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell
When I embark.

[]

Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar
When I put out to sea.

[]

But O! for the touch of a vanish'd hand,
And the sound of a voice that is still!

[]

God's finger touched him, and he slept.

[]

Death has made
His darkness beautiful with thee.

[]

The great world's altar-stairs
That slope thro' darkness up to God.

[]

He that would die well must always look for death, every day knocking at the gates of the grave; and then the gates of the grave shall never prevail upon him to do him mischief.

[]

Death is not rare, alas! nor burials few,
And soon the grassy coverlet of God
Spreads equal green above their ashes pale.

[]

An honorable death is better than a dishonorable life.

[]

On the mountains of memory, by the world's wellsprings,
In all men's eyes,
Where the light of the life of him is on all past things,
Death only dies.

[]

For thee, O now a silent soul, my brother,
Take at my hands this garland and farewell.
Thin is the leaf, and chill the wintry smell,
And chill the solemn earth, a fatal mother.

[]

Death, if thou wilt, fain would I plead with thee:
Canst thou not spare, of all our hopes have built,
One shelter where our spirits fain would be
Death, if thou wilt?

[]

They are both spectacular, life and death.

[]

Life and death merge in greatness.

[]

If birth is a manifestation of life, death is another.

[]

Life into death—life’s other shape; no rupture, only crossing.

[]

A free man thinks of death least of all things; and his wisdom is a meditation not of death but of life.

[]

Death slue not him, but he made death his ladder to the skies.

[]

Death is an equall doome
To good and bad, the common In of rest.

[]

Death, for the author of the John Gospel as for the strict Moslem, is not the end of life, but a Something, a death-force, that contends with a life-force for the possession of man.

[]

How we face death is at least as important as how we deal with life.

[]

Death is the waiting-room where we robe ourselves for immortality.

[]

Death! to the happy thou art terrible;
But how the wretched love to think of thee,
O thou true comforter! the friend of all
Who have no friend beside!

[]

Death is not the worst evil, but rather when we wish to die and cannot.

[]

Death is one of two things. Either it is annihilation, and the dead have no consciousness of anything; or, as we are told, it is really a change: a migration of the soul from this place to another.

[]

Tarry with me, O my Saviour!
Lay my head upon Thy breast,
Till the morning; then awake me—
Morning of eternal rest.

[]

To our graves we walk
In the thick footprints of departed men.

[]

Dead is she? No; rather let us call ourselves dead, who tire so soon in the service of the Master whom she has gone to serve forever.

[]

We count it death to falter, not to die.

[]

Death without phrases.

[]

He that on his pillow lies,
Fear-embalmed before he dies
Carries, like a sheep, his life,
To meet the sacrificer's knife,
And for eternity is prest,
Sad bell-wether to the rest.

[]

Death calls ye to the crowd of common men.

[]

First our pleasures die—and then
Our hopes, and then our fears—and when
These are dead, the debt is due,
Dust claims dust—and we die too.

[]

The babe is at peace within the womb,
The corpse is at rest within the tomb.
We begin in what we end.

[]

Cowards die many times before their deaths;
The valiant never taste of death but once.
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
Will come when it will come.

[]

To die, —to sleep;—
To sleep! perchance to dream...

[]

Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not be forever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st tis common; all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.

[]

Death's pale flag advanced in his cheeks.

[]

On him does death lie heavily, who, but too well known to all, dies to himself unknown.

[]

To die without fear of death is to be desired.

[]

Any one may take life from man, but no one death; a thousand gates stand open to it.

[]

Sometimes death is a punishment; often a gift; it has been a favor to many.

[]

This day, which thou fearest as thy last, is the birthday of eternity.

[]

It is uncertain in what place death may await thee; therefore expect it in any place.

[]

It is folly to die of the fear of death.

[]

They are not lost but sent before.

[]

They will not live, and do not know how to die.

[]

No man can have a peaceful life who thinks too much about lengthening it.

[]

For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.

[]

...who understands that he is dying daily?

[]

It is an extreme evil to depart from the company of the living before you die.

[]

What new thing then is it for a man to die, whose whole life is nothing else but a journey to death?

[]

So die as though your funeral
Ushered you through the doors that led
Into a stately banquet hall
Where heroes banqueted.

[]

I have a rendezvous with Death

[]

Death is a stage in human progress to be passed as we would pass from childhood to youth or from youth to manhood, and with the same consciousness of an ever-unfolding nature.

[]

Like the dew on the mountain,
Like the foam on the river,
Like the bubble on the fountain,
Thou art gone, and for ever!

[]

Soon the shroud shall lap thee fast,
And the sleep be on thee cast
That shall ne'er know waking.

[]

Haste thee, haste thee, to be gone!
Earth flits fast and time draws on:
Gasp thy gasp, and groan thy groan!
Day is near the breaking.

[]

You can rest in peace only because you are awake.

[]

There is no death.

[]

Each day is a little life: every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death.

[]

Good night, Gordon. I am thinking of taking a long sleep.

[]

If you do not dare to die you will never win life.

[]

Day's lustrous eyes grow heavy in sweet death.

[]

I hope that Allah will not make me immortal, for death is his greatest gift to any true believer.

[]

Death makes sad stories of us all.

[]

We may have years, we may have hours, but sooner or later, we push up flowers.

[]

One day in the afternoon of the world, glum death will come and sit in you, and when you get up to walk, you will be as glum as death, but if you're lucky, this will only make the fun better and the love greater.

[]

Death is the inventor of God.

[]

Death must be an evil—and the gods agree;
for why else would they live for ever?

[]

There is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval.

[]

Out of the chill and the shadow,
Into the thrill and the shine;
Out of the dearth and the famine,
Into the fulness divine.

[]

To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead.

[]

Yet once more I shall die as Man, to soar
With angels blest; but even from angelhood
I must pass on: all except God doth perish.

[]

Death is the privilege of human nature,
And life without it were not worth our taking:
Thither the poor, the pris'ner, and the mourner
Fly for relief, and lay their burthens down.

[]

I go to see the sun for the last time.

[]

When I am dead, my dearest,
Sing no sad songs for me;
Plant thou no roses at my head,
No shady cypress tree.

[]

There is no music more for him:
His lights are out, his feast is done;
His bowl that sparkled to the brim
Is drained, is broken, cannot hold.

[]

Sleep that no pain shall wake,
Night that no morn shall break,
Till joy shall overtake
Her perfect peace.

[]

Mortal danger is an effective antidote for fixed ideas.

[]

Those that he loved so long and sees no more,
Loved and still loves—not dead, but gone before,
He gathers round him.

[]

And so, you see, simplicity
Requires that our lot
Be that we exit, when we must,
With only what we brought.

[]

The struggles, the disillusions, and the enmities of life are a part of daily experience. Either death should bring compensating oblivion, or it should throw the mantle of charity over our frailties.

[]

The imminence of death serves to sweep away the inessential preoccupations for those who do not flee from the thought of death into triviality.

[]

The long sleep of death closes our scars, and the short sleep of life our wounds.

[]

But death we are, and death have always been.

[]

Very Fair, She Sleeps.
Frame Frail, What a Death!
Rose, Close, The Breeze Her Seized.

[]

Sorry about your Uncle Fred, but hey, sometimes you end up dead. Did somebody bonk him in the head? Did somebody pump him full of lead? What the...? Are they trying to be humorous? Betcha glad it wasn't you instead.

[]

Death is always pointless... That is the point.

[]

Hushed in the alabaster arms of Death,
Our young Marcellus sleeps.

[]

And greedy Acheron does not relinquish its prey.

[]

I am going to seek a great perhaps; draw the curtain, the farce is played.

[]

Withdrawn into the peace of this desert,
along with some books, few but wise,
I live in conversation with the deceased,
and listen to the dead with my eyes.

[]

It is the lot of man but once to die.

[]

Death aims with fouler spite
At fairer marks.

[]

There is something beyond the grave; death does not end all, and the pale ghost escapes from the vanquished pyre.

[]

Teach him how to live,
And, oh! still harder lesson! how to die.

[]

I am death, not taxes. I turn up only once.

[]

An uneasy rhythm of life
is more life like than an easy death.

[]

A heap of dust remains of thee;
'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be!

[]

By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd,
By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd,
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd,
By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd.

[]

Vital spark of heavenly flame!
Quit, oh quit this mortal frame.

[]

The world recedes; it disappears;
Heav'n opens on my eyes; my ears
With sounds seraphic ring:
Lend, lend your wings! I mount! I fly!
O Grave! where is thy victory?
O Death! where is thy sting?

[]

Tell me, my soul! can this be death?

[]

But thousands die without or this or that,
Die, and endow a college or a cat.

[]

Till tired, he sleeps, and life's poor play is o'er.

[]

O Death, all eloquent! you only prove
What dust we dote on, when 'tis man we love.

[]

See my lips tremble and my eyeballs roll,
Suck my last breath, and catch my flying soul!

[]

Out—out are the lights—out all!
And, over each quivering form,
The curtain, a funeral pall,
Comes down with the rush of a storm,
And the angels, all pallid and wan,
Uprising, unveiling, affirm
That the play is the tragedy, "Man,"
And its hero the Conqueror Worm.

[]

Come! let the burial rite be read—
The funeral song be sung!—
An anthem for the queenliest dead
That ever died so young—
A dirge for her, the doubly dead
In that she died so young.

[]

Concerning the dead nothing but good shall be spoken.

[]

His last day places man in the same state as he was before he was born; nor after death has the body or soul any more feeling than they had before birth.

[]

He whom the gods love dies young, whilst he is full of health, perception, and judgment.

[]

Look forward a little further to the period when all the noise and tumult and business of this world shall have closed forever.

[]

For life is nearer every day to death.

[]

For death betimes is comfort, not dismay,
And who can rightly die needs no delay.

[]

O lady, he is dead and gone!
Lady, he's dead and gone!
And at his head a green grass turfe,
And at his heels a stone.

[]

Death comes to all. His cold and sapless hand
Waves o'er the world, and beckons us away.
Who shall resist the summons?

[]

Death is repose, but the thought of death disturbs all repose.

[]

Death's but a path that must be trod,
If man would ever pass to God.

[]

I don't care when I die, when you die, you die. What I don't want is to die in my bed. To be killed in an accident or to be shot is my preferred way to die.

[]

Wherever you look there is nothing but the image of death.

[]

Death is not grievous to me, for I shall lay aside my pains by death.

[]

Man should ever look to his last day, and no one should be called happy before his funeral.

[]

Thou fool, what is sleep but the image of death? Fate will give an eternal rest.

[]

We are all bound thither; we are hastening to the same common goal. Black death calls all things under the sway of its laws.

[]

And die with decency.

[]

Everybody dies. The obstetrician slaps you on the ass with one hand and hands you a postdated death certificate with the other.

[]

Impermanent are compounded things, prone to rise and fall,
Having risen, they are destroyed, their passing truest bliss.

[]

All beings in the world, all bodies must break up:
Even the Teacher, peerless in the human world,
The mighty Lord and perfect Buddha has passed away.

[]

Death is not the opposite of life; it exists as a part of them.

[]

Yes, death, —the hourly possibility of it, —death is the sublimity of life.

[]

How short is human life! the very breath
Which frames my words accelerates my death.

[]

There's nothing terrible in death;
'Tis but to cast our robes away,
And sleep at night, without a breath
To break repose till dawn of day.

[]

Death, they say, acquits us of all obligations.

[]

Philosophy first commands us to have death ever before our eyes, to anticipate it and consider it beforehand, and then she gives us rules and caveats in order to forestall our being hurt by our reflections!

[]

Rome can give no dispensation from death.

[]

We are all mortal, and each one is for himself.

[]

And over them triumphant Death his dart
Shook, but delay'd to strike, though oft invoked.

[]

How gladly would I meet
Mortality my sentence, and be earth
Insensible! how glad would lay me down
As in my mother's lap!

[]

Behind her Death
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet
On his pale horse.

[]

Eas'd the putting off
These troublesome disguises which we wear.

[]

Death
Grinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear
His famine should be filled.

[]

Before mine eyes in opposition sits
Grim Death, my son and foe.

[]

I fled, and cried out Death;
Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sigh'd
From all her caves, and back resounded Death.

[]

So spake the grisly Terror.

[]

O fairest flower; no sooner blown but blasted,
Soft, silken primrose fading timelessly.

[]

Death cannot come To him untimely who is fit to die; The less of this cold world, the more of heaven; The briefer life, the earlier immortality.

[]

Today if death did not exist, it would be necessary to invent it.

[]

Death is delightful. Death is dawn,
The waking from a weary night
Of fevers unto truth and light.

[]

If I should die to-night,
My friends would look upon my quiet face
Before they laid it in its resting-place,
And deem that death had left it almost fair.

[]

There's nothing certain in man's life but this:
That he must lose it.

[]

He whom the gods love dies young.

[]

At the end of your life, you're lucky if you die.

[]

There is no death! the stars go down
To rise upon some other shore,
And bright in Heaven's jeweled crown,
They shine for ever more.

[]

Death is for the living and not for the dead.

[]

The world has created no living thing it does not intend to destroy.

[]

In this world, one day death is going to take the life from everything that you love. So while you're able, love what you have. Takes the death from your life.

[]

I am afraid to die sometimes, but God is the one to decide when a person dies. I want to live to the fullest until then.

[]

Death hath a thousand doors to let out life.
I shall find one.

[]

She thought our good-night kiss was given,
And like a lily her life did close;
Angels uncurtain'd that repose,
And the next waking dawn'd in heaven.

[]

Death opens unknown doors. It is most grand to die.

[]

When Life knocks at the door no one can wait,
When Death makes his arrest we have to go.

[]

Death is not worse than a dishonourable life which destroys its own soul as well as that of its neighbour.

[]

This I ask, is it not madness to kill thyself in order to escape death?

[]

I want to meet my God awake.

[]

We begin to die as soon as we are born, and the end is linked to the beginning.

[]

All our knowledge merely helps us to die a more painful death than the animals that know nothing.

[]

In the real world, people die, and no self-promoting asshole in a fucking leotard can stop it.


[]

Death is something inevitable.

[]

It is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.

[]

There is no such thing as death.
In nature nothing dies.
From each sad remnant of decay
Some forms of life arise.

[]

What is our death but a night's sleep? 

[]

To every man upon this earth
Death cometh soon or late,
And how can man die better
Than facing fearful odds,
For the ashes of his fathers
And the temples of his gods?

[]

Nay, the greatest wits and poets, too, cease to live;
Homer, their prince, sleeps now in the same forgotten sleep as do the others.

[]

From the very jaws of death I have escaped to this condition.

[]

The coward and the courageous alike must die.

[]

Death is free from the restraint of Fortune; the earth takes everything which it has brought forth.

[]

The gods conceal from those destined to live how sweet it is to die, that they may continue living.

[]

But life is sweet, though all that makes it sweet
Lessen like sound of friends' departing feet;
And Death is beautiful as feet of friend
Coming with welcome at our journey's end.

[]

That is not dead which can eternal lie
And with strange aeons even Death may die.

[]

I imagined it was more difficult to die.

[]

Then fell upon the house a sudden gloom,
A shadow on those features fair and thin;
And softly, from the hushed and darkened room,
Two angels issued, where but one went in.

[]

Oh, what hadst thou to do with cruel Death,
Who wast so full of life, or Death with thee,
That thou shouldst die before thou hadst grown old!

[]

There is no flock, however watched and tended,
But one dead lamb is there!
There is no fireside howsoe'er defended,
But has one vacant chair.

[]

There is no Death! What seems so is transition;
This life of mortal breath
Is but a suburb of the life elysian,
Whose portal we call Death.

[]

There is a Reaper whose name is Death,
And with his sickle keen,
He reaps the bearded grain at a breath,
And the flowers that grow between.

[]

Death never takes one alone, but two!
Whenever he enters in at a door,
Under roof of gold or roof of thatch,
He always leaves it upon the latch,
And comes again ere the year is o'er,
Never one of a household only.

[]

There is no confessor like unto Death!
Thou canst not see him, but he is near:
Thou needest not whisper above thy breath,
And he will hear;
He will answer the questions,
The vague surmises and suggestions,
That fill thy soul with doubt and fear.

[]

The young may die, but the old must!

[]

And, as she looked around, she saw how Death, the consoler,
Laying his hand upon many a heart, had healed it forever.

[]

O Time! consumer of all things; O envious age! thou dost destroy all things and devour all things with the relentless teeth of years, little by little in a slow death.

[]

'What you love, you will love. What you undertake you will complete. You are a fulfiller of hope; you are to be relied on. But seventeen years give little armor against despair...Consider, Arren. To refuse death is to refuse life.

[]

Neither the sun nor death can be looked at with a steady eye.

[]

Only one ship is seeking us, a black-
Sailed unfamiliar, towing at her back
A huge and birdless silence. In her wake
No waters breed or break.

[]

The first day after a death, the new absence
Is always the same; we should be careful
Of each other, we should be kind
While there is still time.

[]

One destin'd period men in common have,
The great, the base, the coward, and the brave,
All food alike for worms, companions in the grave.

[]

No one dies but some one is glad of it.

[]

Gone before
To that unknown and silent shore.

[]

When death finally comes you will welcome it like an old friend, aware of how dreamlike and impermanent the whole phenomenal world really is.

[]

Karma takes no account of custom; and the karma of cruelty is the most terrible of all... The fate of the cruel must fall also upon all who go out intentionally to kill God's creatures, and call it "sport".

[]

You must give up all feeling of possession. Karma may take from you the things which you like best—even the people whom you love most. Even then you must be cheerful—ready to part with anything and everything.

[]

You must bear your karma cheerfully, whatever it may be, taking it as an honor that Suffering comes to you, because it shows that the Lords of Karma think you worth helping. However hard it is, be thankful that it is no worse.

[]

The thunderstorm is a constant phenomenon, raging alternately over some part of the world or the other. Can a single man or creature escape death if all that charge of lightning strikes the earth?

[]

Let the dead bury the dead? But, the dead can bury no one.

[]

When I have folded up this tent
And laid the soiled thing by,
I shall go forth 'neath different stars,
Under an unknown sky.

[]

Nay, why should I fear Death,
Who gives us life, and in exchange takes breath?

[]

If being a kid is about learning how to live, then being a grown-up is about learning how to die.

[]

Strange—is it not?—that of the myriads who
Before us passed the door of Darkness through,
Not one returns to tell us of the road
Which to discover we must travel too.

[]

When you and I behind the Veil are past.

[]

Despite the solace of hypocritical religiosity and its seductive promise of an after-life of heavenly bliss, most of us will do anything to thwart the inevitable victory of biological death.

[]

Dying is not a crime.

[]

No one can obtain from the Pope a dispensation for never dying.

[]

Love masters agony; the soul that seemed
Forsaken feels her present God again
And in her Father's arms
Contented dies away.

[]

Verse, Fame and beauty are intense indeed,
But Death intenser—Death is life's high mead.

[]

They say you only live once, but come to think of it—you only die once as well.

[]

Death is no disgrace.

[]

Trust to a plank, draw precarious breath,
At most seven inches from the jaws of death.

[]

Death alone discloses how insignificant are the puny bodies of men.

[]

There is no 'death'; it is only a question of passing from one level of awareness to another, from physical consciousness to spiritual consciousness. 

[]

Thou art but gone before,
Whither the world must follow.

[]

Disease generally begins that equality which death completes.

[]

Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.

[]

Then with no fiery throbbing pain,
No cold gradations of decay,
Death broke at once the vital chain,
And freed his soul the nearest way.

[]

I am not afraid to kill you for there is no death.

[]

And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. 

[]

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

[]

No one wants to die.

[]

You're on your way to meet your maker... Are you ready? No exceptions to the rule; death is promised.

[]

Death's got to be easy, because life is hard. It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred.

[]

In the democracy of the dead all men at last are equal. There is neither rank nor station nor prerogative in the republic of the grave.

[]

Duty is weightier than a mountain, while death is lighter than a feather.

[]

It is better to die well, than to live wrongly... who is afraid of death loses the joy of life; truth prevails all, prevails who is killed, because no adversity can harm him, who is not dominated by injustice .

[]

Sweet and glorious it is to die for our country.

[]

Death takes the mean man with the proud;
The fatal urn has room for all.

[]

Cita mors ruit.

[]

Swift death rushes upon us.

[]

In the capacious urn of death, every name is shaken.

[]

We are all compelled to take the same road; from the urn of death, shaken for all, sooner or later the lot must come forth.

[]

One night is awaiting us all, and the way of death must be trodden once.

[]

Pale death, with impartial step, knocks at the hut of the poor and the towers of kings.

[]

'Tis after death that we measure men.

[]

We watch'd her breathing thro' the night,
Her breathing soft and low,
As in her breast the wave of life
Kept heaving to and fro.
Our very hopes belied our fears,
Our fears our hopes belied;
We thought her dying when she slept,
And sleeping when she died.

[]

One more unfortunate
Weary of breath,
Rashly importunate,
Gone to her death!

[]

It is not right to glory in the slain.

[]

He slept an iron sleep,—
Slain fighting for his country.

[]

And they die
An equal death,—the idler and the man
Of mighty deeds.

[]

Behold—not him we knew!
This was the prison which his soul looked through.

[]

The mossy marbles rest
On the lips that he has pressed
In their bloom;
And the names he loved to hear
Have been carved for many a year
On the tomb.

[]

When darkness gathers over all.
And the last tottering pillars fall,
Take the poor dust Thy mercy warms.
And mould it into heavenly forms.

[]

live
so nothing will be left
for death at the end

[]

How frighteningly few are the persons whose death would spoil our appetite and make the world seem empty.

[]

Now I am about to take my last voyage, a great leap in the dark.

[]

Death when to death a death by death hath given
Then shall be op't the long shut gates of heaven.

[]

And death makes equal the high and low.

[]

Upon the Grave which swallows fast
'Tis peace at last, oh peace at last.

[]

I know thou art gone to the home of thy rest—
Then why should my soul be so sad?
I know thou art gone where the weary are blest,
And the mourner looks up, and is glad;

[]

I know thou hast drank of the Lethe that flows
In a land where they do not forget,
That sheds over memory only repose,
And takes from it only regret.

[]

Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!

[]

Those that God loves, do not live long.

[]

Præmissi non amissi.

[]

Not lost, but gone before.

[]

From the winter’s gray despair,
From the summer’s golden languor,
Death, the lover of Life,
Frees us for ever.

[]

Out of the reddest hell of the fight
I may be snatched and flung
Into the everlasting lull,
The immortal, incommunicable dream.

[]

Dear, was it really you and I?
In truth the riddle's ill to read,
So many are the deaths we die
Before we can be dead indeed.

[]

Arise! no more a living lie,
And with me quicken and control
Some memory that shall magnify
The universal Soul.

[]

Life is worth Living
Through every grain of it,
From the foundations
To the last edge
Of the cornerstone, death.

[]

Who says that we shall pass, or the fame of us fade and die,
While the living stars fulfil their round in the living sky?

[]

Those incantations of the Spring
That made the heart a centre of miracles
Grow formal, and the wonder-working bours
Arise no more—no more.

Something is dead . . .

[]

So be my passing.
My task accomplished and the long day done,
My wages taken, and in my heart
Some late lark singing,
Let me be gathered to the quiet west,
The sundown splendid and serene,
Death.

[]

What is Death
But Life in act? How should the Unteeming Grave
Be victor over thee,
Mother, a mother of men?

[]

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid.

[]

"Passing away" is written on the world and all the world contains.

[]

Leaves have their time to fall,
And flowers to wither at the north wind's breath,
And stars to set—but all.
Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death.

[]

For dying is not to be feared—it is the final comfort. As we all learn, eventually.

[]

Death rides on every passing breeze,
He lurks in every flower.

[]

And I hear from the outgoing ship in the bay
The song of the sailors in glee:
So I think of the luminous footprints that bore
The comfort o'er dark Galilee,
And wait for the signal to go to the shore,
To the ship that is waiting for me.

[]

The ancients dreaded death: the Christian can only fear dying.

[]

Yes, even pricks turn into top blokes after death

[]

When at last the angels come to convey your departing spirit to Abraham's bosom, depend upon it, however dazzling in their newness they may be to you, you will find that your history is no novelty, and you yourself no stranger to them.

[]

Seek such union to the Son of God, as, leaving no present death within, shall make the second death impossible, and shall leave in all your future only that shadow of death which men call dissolution, and which the gospel calls sleeping in Jesus.

[]

All life is surrounded by a great circumference of death; but to the believer in Jesus, beyond this surrounding death is a boundless sphere of life. He has only to die once to be done with death forever.

[]

We shall be in the midst of some great work, when the tools shall drop from our relaxing fingers, and we shall work no more; we shall be planning some mighty project—house, business, society, book —when in one shattering moment all our thoughts shall perish. 

[]

Ere the dolphin dies
Its hues are brightest. Like an infant's breath
Are tropic winds before the voice of death.

[]

Come to the bridal-chamber, Death!
Come to the mother's, when she feels,
For the first time, her first-born's breath!
Come when the blessed seals
That close the pestilence are broke,
And crowded cities wail its stroke!

[]

Death borders upon our birth; and our cradle stands in our grave.

[]

Man has the possibility of existence after death. But possibility is one thing and the realization of the possibility is quite a different thing.

[]

Fling but a stone, the giant dies.

[]

He pass'd the flaming bounds of place and time:
The living throne, the sapphire blaze,
Where angels tremble while they gaze,
He saw; but blasted with excess of light,
Closed his eyes in endless night.

[]

Can storied urn or animated bust
Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
Or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death?

[]

He had never feared the entity Death but was often afraid of dying.

[]

Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.

[]

Where the brass knocker, wrapt in flannel band,
Forbids the thunder of the footman's hand,
The' upholder, rueful harbinger of death,
Waits with impatience for the dying breath.

[]

Dead as a door nail.

[]

The prince who kept the world in awe,
The judge whose dictate fix'd the law;
The rich, the poor, the great, the small,
Are levell'd; death confounds 'em all.

[]

To die is landing on some silent shore,
Where billows never break nor tempests roar;
Ere well we feel the friendly stroke 'tis o'er.

[]

Life's race well run,
Life's work well done,
Life's crown well won,
Now comes rest.

[]

Had Christ the death of death to death
Not given death by dying:
The gates of life had never been
To mortals open lying.

[]

Drawing near her death, she sent most pious thoughts as harbingers to heaven; and her soul saw a glimpse of happiness through the chinks of her sicknesse broken body.

[]

Human beings desire more than small pleasures in the routines of life. We also seek great challenges in the face of death.

[]

Why fear death? It is the most beautiful adventure in life.

[]

The mountain is passed; now we shall get on better.

[]

Death smiles at us all. All a man can do is smile back.

[]

A dying man can do nothing easy.

[]

We must all die!
All leave ourselves, it matters not where, when,
Nor how, so we die well; and can that man that does so
Need lamentation for him?

[]

Death hath so many doors to let out life.

[]

Young Never-Grow-Old, with your heart of gold
And the dear boy's face upon you;
It is hard to tell, though we know it well,
That the grass is growing upon you.

[]

Sit the comedy out, and that done,
When the Play's at an end, let the Curtain fall down.

[]

On a long enough timeline the survival rate for everybody drops to zero.

[]

I am not in the least surprised that your impression of death becomes more lively, in proportion as age and infirmity bring it nearer. God makes use of this rough trial to undeceive us in respect to our courage, to make us feel our weakness, and to keep us in all humility in His hands.

[]

He that always waits upon God is ready whenever He calls. Neglect not to set your accounts even; he is a happy man who to lives as that death at all times may find him at leisure to die.

[]

I cried to Thee, O Lord; and unto the Lord I made supplication. What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise Thee? Shall it declare Thy truth?

[]

But learn that to die is a debt we must all pay.

[]

What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise Thee? 

[]

He thought it happier to be dead,
To die for Beauty, than live for bread.

[]

If we could know
Which of us, darling, would be first to go,
Who would be first to breast the swelling tide
And step alone upon the other side—
If we could know!

[]

Death is the king of this world: 'tis his park
Where he breeds life to feed him. Cries of pain
Are music for his banquet.

[]

I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.

[]

Death is the way to immortality. Love will begin when the world ends.

[]

In the jaws of death.

[]

Like a led victim, to my death I'll go,
And dying, bless the hand that gave the blow.

[]

He was exhal'd; his great Creator drew
His spirit, as the sun the morning dew.

[]

Heaven gave him all at once; then snatched away,
Ere mortals all his beauties could survey;
Just like the flower that buds and withers in a day.

[]

Of no distemper, of no blast he died,
But fell like autumn fruit that mellow'd long.

[]

So was she soon exhaled, and vanished hence;
As a sweet odour, of a vast expense.
She vanished, we can scarcely say she died.

[]

Death in itself is nothing; but we fear
To be we know not what, we know not where.

[]

Welcome, thou kind deceiver!
Thou best of thieves! who, with an easy key,
Dost open life, and, unperceived by us,
Even steal us from ourselves.

[]

One short sleepe past, wee wake eternally,
And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die.

[]

Death be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not so,
For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow,
Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill me.

[]

The answer to death was to make use of it rather than fall victim to it—master it by making it serve his goals, beliefs. This was not a good answer. But it was the only answer he had.

[]

The dead cannot be restored. They can be remembered. They can be mourned. But they are still dead.

[]

Soon for me the light of day
Shall forever pass away;
Then from sin and sorrow free,
Take me, Lord, to dwell with Thee.

[]

It ’s such a little thing to weep,
So short a thing to sigh;
And yet by trades the size of these
We men and women die!

[]

"People can't die, along the coast," said Mr. Peggotty, "except when the tide's pretty nigh out. They can't be born, unless it's pretty nigh in—not properly born, till flood. He's a-going out with the tide."

[]

What argufies pride and ambition?
Soon or late death will take us in tow:
Each bullet has got its commission,
And when our time's come we must go.

[]

Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.

[]

I expressed just now my mistrust of what is called Spiritualism—… I owe it a trifle for a message said to come from Voltaire's Ghost. It was asked, "Are you not now convinced of another world?" and rapped out, "There is no other world —Death is only an incident in Life."

[]

Every living movement is a sliding toward death. But if they are willing to look it in the face they also discover that every movement toward death is life.

[]

And though mine arm should conquer twenty worlds,
There's a lean fellow beats all conquerors.

[]

Round, round the cypress bier
Where she lies sleeping,
On every turf a tear,
Let us go weeping!
Wail!

Death is utterly acceptable to consciousness and life. There has been endless times of numberless deaths, but neither consciousness nor life has ceased to arise. The felt quality and cycle to death has not modified the fragility of flowers, even the flowers within the human body.

[]

The most heaven-like spots I have ever visited, have been certain rooms in which Christ's disciples were awaiting the summons of death. So far from being a "house of mourning," I have often found such a house to be a vestibule of glory.

[]

We are born, then cry,
We know not for why,
And all our lives long
Still but the same song.

She'l bargain with them; and will giue
Them GOD; teach them how to liue
In him; or if they this deny,
For him she'l teach them how to Dy.

Life, that dares send
A challenge to his end,
And when it comes, say, "Welcome, friend!"

[]

Two hands upon the breast,
And labor's done;
Two pale feet cross'd in rest,
The race is won.

[]

All has its date below; the fatal hour
Was register'd in Heav'n ere time began.
We turn to dust, and all our mightiest works
Die too.

[]

All flesh is grass, and all its glory fades
Like the fair flower dishevell'd in the wind;
Riches have wings, and grandeur is a dream;
The man we celebrate must find a tomb,
And we that worship him, ignoble graves.

[]

So that he seemed to depart not from life, but from one home to another.

[]

He who does not fear death cares naught for threats.

[]

Dead’s not good, but at least it’s simple.

[]

Death comes with a crawl or he comes with a pounce,
And whether he's slow, or spry,
It isn't the fact that you're dead that counts,
But only, how did you die?

[]

Death is like thunder in two particulars; we are alarmed at the sound of it; and it is formidable only from that which preceded it.

[]

Death levels master and slave, the sceptre and the law, and makes the unlike like.

[]

How well he fell asleep!
Like some proud river, widening toward the sea;
Calmly and grandly, silently and deep,
Life joined eternity.

Bloody pumps, face flat on the concrete. Here comes the white sheet. Mister Coroner, caught with some yellow tape, but the murderers escaped.

Our souls are prisoners of the terror of death, and the day is beautiful.

Death equalizes the scepter and the spade

Death knows no rank.

Omnia mors æquat.

Death levels all things.

Death, to a good man is but passing through a dark entry, out of one little dusky room of his Father's house into another that is fair and large, lightsome and glorious, and divinely entertaining.

[]

Some men make a womanish complaint that it is a great misfortune to die before our time. I would ask what time? Is it that of Nature? But she, indeed, has lent us life, as we do a sum of money, only no certain day is fixed for payment. What reason then to complain if she demands it at pleasure, since it was on this condition that you received it.

[]

That last day does not bring extinction to us, but change of place.

[]

There are countless roads on all sides to the grave.

[]

The divinity who rules within us, forbids us to leave this world without his command.

[]

I do not wish to die: but I care not if I were dead.

[]

I depart from life as from an inn, and not as from my home.

[]

I’m not a morbid person, but I thought about death—or more precisely, how strangely tilted our view of life is. We know the universe went on before for billions of years and it will go on for billions more. There’s just this brief stretch when the window is opened before our eyes, and the world is visible. Then the window is shut, forever.

[]

At length, fatigued with life, he bravely fell,
And health with Boerhaave bade the world farewell.

Death is not the end. Death can never be the end. Death is the road. Life is the traveller. The soul is the guide.

[]

Back in 1980, less than 5 percent of Americans were cremated when they died. That figure now stands at about 50 percent... Rosehill charges just $180 to cremate a body, although the urn, flowers, and service are extra. A grave, by contrast, can cost $2,500, plus an additional $1,500 to open the ground with a backhoe.

[]

When I hear it contended that the least sensitive are, on the whole, the most happy, I recall the Indian proverb: “It’s better to sit than to stand, it is better lie down than to sit, but death is best of all.”

[]

This character wherewith we sink into the grave at death is the very character wherewith we shall reappear at the resurrection.

[]

It singeth low in every heart,
We hear it each and all,—
A song of those who answer not,
However we may call;
They throng he silence of the breast,
We see them as of yore,—
The kind, the brave, the true, the sweet,
Who walk with us no more.

[]

"For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death does not remove." 

"And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it?"

With regard to their actual course of studies, the main object of all education is, in their opinion, to imbue their scholars with a firm belief in the indestructibility of the human soul, which, according to their belief, merely passes at death from one tenement to another; for by such doctrine alone, they say, which robs death of all its terrors, can the highest form of human courage be developed.

[]

The principal point of their doctrine is that the soul does not die and that after death it passes from one body into another.

[]

When death hath poured oblivion through my veins,
And brought me home, as all are brought, to lie
In that vast house, common to serfs and thanes,—
I shall not die, I shall not utterly die,
For beauty born of beauty—that remains.

[]

Suns may set and rise; we, when our short day has closed, must sleep on during one neverending night.

[]

Who now travels that dark path from whose bourne they say no one returns.

[]

What does one do when it comes time to die? Turn
one's face to the wall?
Grab the shoulders of the person who is closest, who listens?
Does one break into a run, like a man whose clothing
is on fire, and make a dash to the finish?

[]

Be sure the safest rule is that we should not dare to live in any scene in which we dare not die.

[]

I believe this thought, of the possibility of death —if calmly realised, and steadily faced would be one of the best possible tests as to our going to any scene of amusement being right or wrong.

His religion, at best, is an anxious wish; like that of Rabelais, "a great Perhaps."

Oh man, at that end not much has been left of your excellence, nothing of all that you have been boasting about through life - only sex, fear, self-admiration and a few other things you are usually ashamed of.

And I still onward haste to my last night;
Time's fatal wings do ever forward fly;
So every day we live, a day we die.

Brougham delivered a very warm panegyric upon the ex-Chancellor, and expressed a hope that he would make a good end, although to an expiring Chancellor death was now armed with a new terror.

[]

To live in hearts we leave behind
is not to die.

[]

But this we may positively state, that nobody has made any progress in the school of Christ unless he cheerfully looks forward to the day of his death and to the day of the final resurrection.

[]

Down to the dust! —and, as thou rott'st away,
Even worms shall perish on thy poisonous clay.

[]

Oh, God! it is a fearful thing
To see the human soul take wing
In any shape, in any mood!

[]

Death, so called, is a thing which makes men weep,
And yet a third of life is pass'd in sleep.

[]

"Whom the gods love die young," was said of yore.

[]

Ah! surely nothing dies but something mourns!

Without a grave, unknell'd, uncoffin'd, and unknown.

Heaven gives its favourites—early death.

Friend Ralph! thou hast
Outrun the constable at last!

The fear of death is worse than death.

[]

We wonder if this can be really the close,
Life's fever cooled by death's trance;
And we cry, though it seems to our dearest of foes,
"God give us another chance."

[]

They do neither plight nor wed
In the city of the dead,
In the city where they sleep away the hours.

[]

There is only rest and peace
In the city of Surcease
From the failings and the waitings 'neath the sun,
And the wings of the swift years
Beat but gently o'er the biers
Making music to the sleepers every one.

[]

But, oh! fell Death's untimely frost,
That nipt my flower sae early.

The dead ride swiftly.

...the great death waits to gather me in its stars.

How immense is being, when you thought yourself dead!

So he passed over and all the trumpets sounded
For him on the other side.

All that tread
The globe are but a handful to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom.

Sustained and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave
Like one that wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

The drama of death has always seemed to me the truest element in life.

[]

Fear Death?—to feel the fog in my throat,
The mist in my face.

[]

The grand perhaps.

[]

For I say, this is death and the sole death,
When a man's loss comes to him from his gain,
Darkness from light, from knowledge ignorance,
And lack of love from love made manifest.

[]

O Earth, so full of dreary noises!
O men, with wailing in your voices!
O delved gold, the waller's heap!
O strife, O curse, that o'er it fall!
God makes a silence through you all,
And "giveth His beloved, sleep."

We all labour against our own cure; for death is the cure of all disease.

The thousand doors that lead to death.

A little before you made a leap in the dark.

[]

Oh! death will find me, long before I tire
Of watching you; and swing me suddenly
Into the shade and loneliness and mire
Of the last land!

[]

'Mid youth and song, feasting and carnival,
Through laughter, through the roses, as of old
Comes Death, on shadowy and relentless feet
Death, unappeasable by prayer or gold;
Death is the end, the end.
Proud, then, clear-eyed and laughing, go to greet
Death as a friend!

[]

Here. Astride the top of nothingness, I suddenly receive the call of death. Who, in passing, tells me that it’s nothing. Nothing more than the absence of the word itself. Nothing more, and simply nothingness.

[]

Is Death important? No. Everything that happens before Death is what counts.

[]

In the midst of life we are in death.

Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection.

Beyond the shining and the shading
I shall be soon.
Beyond the hoping and the dreading
I shall be soon.
Love, rest and home—
Lord! tarry not, but come.

[]

When I lived, I provided for every thing but death; now I must die, and am unprepared.

Physical death, so much a preoccupation in the death world, is less mortifying than what is peddled as life.

[]

Death is never trivial: it is solemnity, it is mystery.

[]

...death is simply a longer sleep than that we experience every night of our lives, after which the soul wakes again in a new body. 

[]

he idea suggested by reincarnation is that the soul, not the brain, continues to live. 

[]

The notions about heaven and hell, with which the people of "Christian" nations are more or less familiar, are probably the crude remains of earlier and more philosophical ideas. If we consider hell and heaven to be states of mind instead of places, it is easy to see the reason for such ideas.

[]

'Tis long since Death had the majority.

[]

Sure 'tis a serious thing to die! My soul!
What a strange moment must it be, when, near
Thy journey's end, thou hast the gulf in view!
That awful gulf, no mortal e'er repass'd
To tell what's doing on the other side.

[]

How shocking must thy summons be, O Death!
To him that is at ease in his possessions!
Who, counting on long years of pleasure here,
Is quite unfurnished for the world to come!
In that dread moment, how the frantic soul
Raves round the walls of her clay tenement;
Runs to each avenue, and shrieks for help;
But shrieks in vain.

[]

Never the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never;
Never was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams!
Birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever;
Death hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it seems!

[]

Never the spirit was born, the spirit shall cease to be never. Never was time it was not, end and beginning are dreams.

[]

For certain is death for the born
And certain is birth for the dead;
Therefore over the inevitable
Thou shouldst not grieve.

[]

Cremation is preferable to burial as a way of disposing of corpses.

[]

Death and dissolution are not penalties inflicted on the living; they are themselves the conditions necessary to the existence of life and they hold all the hope of the future, as they have from the start.

[]

So we fall asleep in Jesus. We have played long enough at the games of life, and at last we feel the approach of death. We are tired out, and we lay our heads back on the bosom of Christ, and quietly fall asleep.

[]

And when no longer we can see Thee, may we reach out our hands, and find Thee leading us through death to immortality and glory.

[]

To the Christian, these shades are the golden haze which heaven's light makes, when it meets the earth, and mingles with its shadows.

[]

But whether on the scaffold high,
Or in the battle's van,
The fittest place where man can die
Is where he dies for man.

[]

To die would be an awfully big adventure.

[]

No man escapes Death. So Death must not be the enemy. Life must not be the prize. It must be the gameboard, on which Death teaches its savage lessons. You could heed those lessons, or ignore them, but never evade them.
Death, then, was the ally. Not to be sought, but heeded.

[]

It is only the dead who do not return.

[]

So fades a summer cloud away;
So sinks the gale when storms are o'er;
So gently shuts the eye of day;
So dies a wave along the shore.

[]

Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have.

[]

There is no harm in patience, and no profit in lamentation. Death is easier to bear [than] that which precedes it, and more severe than that which comes after it. Remember the death of the Apostle of God, and your sorrow will be lessened.

[]

The death-change comes.

[]

Death is another life. We bow our heads
At going out, we think, and enter straight
Another golden chamber of the king's,
Larger than this we leave, and lovelier.
And then in shadowy glimpses, disconnect,
The story, flower-like, closes thus its leaves.
The will of God is all in all. He makes,
Destroys, remakes, for His own pleasure, all.

[]

Death is the universal salt of states;
Blood is the base of all things —law and war.

[]

Life hath more awe than death.

[]

Death, as the human consciousness understands it, pain and sorrow, loss and disaster, joy and distress, are only such because man, as yet, identifies himself with the life of the form and not with the life and consciousness of the soul...

[]

What then remains, but that we still should cry
Not to be born, or being born to die.

[]

It is as natural to die as to be born; and to a little infant, perhaps, the one is as painful as the other.

[]

The pomp of death alarms us more than death itself.

[]

I have often thought upon death, and I find it the least of all evils.

[]

It is worthy the observing, that there is no passion in the mind of man, so weak, but it mates, and masters, the fear of death; and therefore, death is no such terrible enemy, when a man hath so many attendants about him, that can win the combat of him. Revenge triumphs over death; love slights it; honor aspireth to it; grief flieth to it; fear preoccupieth it.

[]

Men fear death, as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other.

[]

Death is a friend of ours; and he that is not ready to entertain him is not at home.


[]

It is not death that a man should fear, but never beginning to live.

[]

Her cabin'd ample spirit,
It fluttered and fail'd for breath;
Tonight it doth inherit
The vasty hall of death.

He who died at Azan sends
This to comfort all his friends:
Faithful friends! It lies I know
Pale and white and cold as snow;
And ye say, "Abdallah's dead!"
Weeping at the feet and head.
I can see your falling tears,
I can hear your sighs and prayers;
Yet I smile and whisper this:
I am not the thing you kiss.
Cease your tears and let it lie;
It was mine—it is not I.

[]

Your lost friends are not dead, but gone before,
Advanced a stage or two upon that road
Which you must travel in the steps they trod.

[]

Men fear death, as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other.

[]

The separation of the spiritual part of the soul from the earthly body does not essentially change that spirit. A person takes with him the sum total of the character he has formed up to that time. Mortal death does not make a person better or worse; it simply adds to him one more experience which, no doubt, has a teachable influence on him.

[]

Every breath you take is a step towards death.

[]

The white sail of his soul has rounded
The promontory—death.

[]

Somewhere, in desolate, wind-swept space,
In twilight land, in no man's land,
Two hurrying shapes met face to face
And bade each other stand.
"And who are you?" cried one, a-gape,
Shuddering in the glimmering light.
"I know not," said the second shape,
"I only died last night."

[]

But when the sun in all his state,
Illumed the eastern skies,
She passed through glory's morning gate,
And walked in Paradise.

[]

The Fear of Death often proves Mortal, and sets People on Methods to save their Lives, which infallibly destroy them.

[]

Call no man happy till he is dead.

[]

Death is a black camel, which kneels at the gates of all.

[]

Death gives meaning to life. Living in fear of death is living in denial. Actually, it's not really living at all, because there is no life without death. It's two sides of the one.

[]

Death is nothing but death, but it prevents life. If you are afraid, life has no value, and if you die, everything dies.
