The most heaven-like spots I have ever visited, have been certain rooms in which Christ's disciples were awaiting the summons of death. So far from being a "house of mourning," I have often found such a house to be a vestibule of glory.

[]

We are born, then cry,
We know not for why,
And all our lives long
Still but the same song.

[]

She'l bargain with them; and will giue
Them GOD; teach them how to liue
In him; or if they this deny,
For him she'l teach them how to Dy.

[]

Life, that dares send
A challenge to his end,
And when it comes, say, "Welcome, friend!"

[]

Two hands upon the breast,
And labor's done;
Two pale feet cross'd in rest,
The race is won.

[]

All has its date below; the fatal hour
Was register'd in Heav'n ere time began.
We turn to dust, and all our mightiest works
Die too.

[]

All flesh is grass, and all its glory fades
Like the fair flower dishevell'd in the wind;
Riches have wings, and grandeur is a dream;
The man we celebrate must find a tomb,
And we that worship him, ignoble graves.

[]

So that he seemed to depart not from life, but from one home to another.

[]

He who does not fear death cares naught for threats.

[]

Dead’s not good, but at least it’s simple.

[]

Death comes with a crawl or he comes with a pounce,
And whether he's slow, or spry,
It isn't the fact that you're dead that counts,
But only, how did you die?

[]

Death is like thunder in two particulars; we are alarmed at the sound of it; and it is formidable only from that which preceded it.

[]

Death levels master and slave, the sceptre and the law, and makes the unlike like.

[]

How well he fell asleep!
Like some proud river, widening toward the sea;
Calmly and grandly, silently and deep,
Life joined eternity.

[]

Bloody pumps, face flat on the concrete. Here comes the white sheet. Mister Coroner, caught with some yellow tape, but the murderers escaped.

[]

Our souls are prisoners of the terror of death, and the day is beautiful.

[]

Death equalizes the scepter and the spade

[]

Death knows no rank.

[]

Omnia mors æquat.

[]

Death levels all things.

[]

Death, to a good man is but passing through a dark entry, out of one little dusky room of his Father's house into another that is fair and large, lightsome and glorious, and divinely entertaining.

[]

Some men make a womanish complaint that it is a great misfortune to die before our time. I would ask what time? Is it that of Nature? But she, indeed, has lent us life, as we do a sum of money, only no certain day is fixed for payment. What reason then to complain if she demands it at pleasure, since it was on this condition that you received it.

[]

That last day does not bring extinction to us, but change of place.

[]

There are countless roads on all sides to the grave.

[]

The divinity who rules within us, forbids us to leave this world without his command.

[]

I do not wish to die: but I care not if I were dead.

[]

I depart from life as from an inn, and not as from my home.

[]

I’m not a morbid person, but I thought about death—or more precisely, how strangely tilted our view of life is. We know the universe went on before for billions of years and it will go on for billions more. There’s just this brief stretch when the window is opened before our eyes, and the world is visible. Then the window is shut, forever.

[]

At length, fatigued with life, he bravely fell,
And health with Boerhaave bade the world farewell.

[]

Death is not the end. Death can never be the end. Death is the road. Life is the traveller. The soul is the guide.

[]

Back in 1980, less than 5 percent of Americans were cremated when they died. That figure now stands at about 50 percent... Rosehill charges just $180 to cremate a body, although the urn, flowers, and service are extra. A grave, by contrast, can cost $2,500, plus an additional $1,500 to open the ground with a backhoe.

[]

When I hear it contended that the least sensitive are, on the whole, the most happy, I recall the Indian proverb: “It’s better to sit than to stand, it is better lie down than to sit, but death is best of all.”

[]

This character wherewith we sink into the grave at death is the very character wherewith we shall reappear at the resurrection.

[]

It singeth low in every heart,
We hear it each and all,—
A song of those who answer not,
However we may call;
They throng (he silence of the breast,
We see them as of yore,—
The kind, the brave, the true, the sweet,
Who walk with us no more.

[]

"For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death does not remove." 

"And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it?"

With regard to their actual course of studies, the main object of all education is, in their opinion, to imbue their scholars with a firm belief in the indestructibility of the human soul, which, according to their belief, merely passes at death from one tenement to another; for by such doctrine alone, they say, which robs death of all its terrors, can the highest form of human courage be developed.

[]

The principal point of their doctrine is that the soul does not die and that after death it passes from one body into another.

[]

When death hath poured oblivion through my veins,
And brought me home, as all are brought, to lie
In that vast house, common to serfs and thanes,—
I shall not die, I shall not utterly die,
For beauty born of beauty—that remains.

[]

Suns may set and rise; we, when our short day has closed, must sleep on during one neverending night.

[]

Who now travels that dark path from whose bourne they say no one returns.

[]

What does one do when it comes time to die? Turn
one's face to the wall?
Grab the shoulders of the person who is closest, who listens?
Does one break into a run, like a man whose clothing
is on fire, and make a dash to the finish?

[]

Be sure the safest rule is that we should not dare to live in any scene in which we dare not die.

[]

I believe this thought, of the possibility of death — if calmly realised, and steadily faced would be one of the best possible tests as to our going to any scene of amusement being right or wrong. 

[]

His religion, at best, is an anxious wish; like that of Rabelais, "a great Perhaps."

[]

Oh man, at that end not much has been left of your excellence, nothing of all that you have been boasting about through life - only sex, fear, self-admiration and a few other things you are usually ashamed of.

[]

And I still onward haste to my last night;
Time's fatal wings do ever forward fly;
So every day we live, a day we die.

[]

Brougham delivered a very warm panegyric upon the ex-Chancellor, and expressed a hope that he would make a good end, although to an expiring Chancellor death was now armed with a new terror.

[]

To live in hearts we leave behind
is not to die.

[]

But this we may positively state, that nobody has made any progress in the school of Christ unless he cheerfully looks forward to the day of his death and to the day of the final resurrection.

[]

Down to the dust! — and, as thou rott'st away,
Even worms shall perish on thy poisonous clay.

[]

Oh, God! it is a fearful thing
To see the human soul take wing
In any shape, in any mood!

[]

Death, so called, is a thing which makes men weep,
And yet a third of life is pass'd in sleep.

[]

"Whom the gods love die young," was said of yore.

[]

Ah! surely nothing dies but something mourns!

[]

Without a grave, unknell'd, uncoffin'd, and unknown.

[]

Heaven gives its favourites—early death.

[]

Friend Ralph! thou hast
Outrun the constable at last!

[]

The fear of death is worse than death.

[]

We wonder if this can be really the close,
Life's fever cooled by death's trance;
And we cry, though it seems to our dearest of foes,
"God give us another chance."

[]

They do neither plight nor wed
In the city of the dead,
In the city where they sleep away the hours.

[]

There is only rest and peace
In the city of Surcease
From the failings and the waitings 'neath the sun,
And the wings of the swift years
Beat but gently o'er the biers
Making music to the sleepers every one.

[]

But, oh! fell Death's untimely frost,
That nipt my flower sae early.

[]

The dead ride swiftly.

[]

...the great death waits to gather me in its stars.

[]

How immense is being, when you thought yourself dead!

[]

So he passed over and all the trumpets sounded
For him on the other side.

[]

All that tread
The globe are but a handful to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom.

[]

Sustained and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave
Like one that wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

[]

The drama of death has always seemed to me the truest element in life.

[]

Fear Death?—to feel the fog in my throat,
The mist in my face.

[]

The grand perhaps.

[]

For I say, this is death and the sole death,
When a man's loss comes to him from his gain,
Darkness from light, from knowledge ignorance,
And lack of love from love made manifest.

[]

O Earth, so full of dreary noises!
O men, with wailing in your voices!
O delved gold, the waller's heap!
O strife, O curse, that o'er it fall!
God makes a silence through you all,
And "giveth His beloved, sleep."

Pliny hath an odd and remarkable Passage concerning the Death of Men and Animals upon the Recess or Ebb of the Sea.

[]

We all labour against our own cure; for death is the cure of all disease.

[]

The thousand doors that lead to death.

[]

A little before you made a leap in the dark.

[]

Oh! death will find me, long before I tire
Of watching you; and swing me suddenly
Into the shade and loneliness and mire
Of the last land!

[]

'Mid youth and song, feasting and carnival,
Through laughter, through the roses, as of old
Comes Death, on shadowy and relentless feet
Death, unappeasable by prayer or gold;
Death is the end, the end.
Proud, then, clear-eyed and laughing, go to greet
Death as a friend!

[]

Here. Astride the top of nothingness, I suddenly receive the call of death. Who, in passing, tells me that it’s nothing. Nothing more than the absence of the word itself. Nothing more, and simply nothingness.

[]

Is Death important? No. Everything that happens before Death is what counts.

[]

In the midst of life we are in death.

[]

Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.

[]

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection.

[]

Beyond the shining and the shading
I shall be soon.
Beyond the hoping and the dreading
I shall be soon.
Love, rest and home—
Lord! tarry not, but come.

[]

When I lived, I provided for every thing but death; now I must die, and am unprepared.

[]

Physical death, so much a preoccupation in the death world, is less mortifying than what is peddled as life.

[]

Death is never trivial: it is solemnity, it is mystery.

[]

...death is simply a longer sleep than that we experience every night of our lives, after which the soul wakes again in a new body. 

[]

he idea suggested by reincarnation is that the soul, not the brain, continues to live. 

[]

The notions about heaven and hell, with which the people of "Christian" nations are more or less familiar, are probably the crude remains of earlier and more philosophical ideas. If we consider hell and heaven to be states of mind instead of places, it is easy to see the reason for such ideas.

[]

'Tis long since Death had the majority.

[]

Sure 'tis a serious thing to die! My soul!
What a strange moment must it be, when, near
Thy journey's end, thou hast the gulf in view!
That awful gulf, no mortal e'er repass'd
To tell what's doing on the other side.

[]

How shocking must thy summons be, O Death!
To him that is at ease in his possessions!
Who, counting on long years of pleasure here,
Is quite unfurnished for the world to come!
In that dread moment, how the frantic soul
Raves round the walls of her clay tenement;
Runs to each avenue, and shrieks for help;
But shrieks in vain.

[]

Never the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never;
Never was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams!
Birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever;
Death hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it seems!

[]

How wilt thou, then, knowing it so,
—grieve when thou shouldst not grieve?
How, if thou hearest that the man new-dead
Is, like the man new-born, still living man—
One same, existent Spirit—wilt thou weep?
The end of birth is death; the end of death
Is birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou,
Chief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls
Which could not otherwise befall?
The birth Of living things comes unperceived;
the death Comes unperceived;
between them, beings perceive:
What is there sorrowful herein, dear Prince?

[]

Never the spirit was born, the spirit shall cease to be never. Never was time it was not, end and beginning are dreams.

[]

For certain is death for the born
And certain is birth for the dead;
Therefore over the inevitable
Thou shouldst not grieve.

[]

Cremation is preferable to burial as a way of disposing of corpses.

[]

Death and dissolution are not penalties inflicted on the living; they are themselves the conditions necessary to the existence of life and they hold all the hope of the future, as they have from the start.

[]

So we fall asleep in Jesus. We have played long enough at the games of life, and at last we feel the approach of death. We are tired out, and we lay our heads back on the bosom of Christ, and quietly fall asleep.

[]

And when no longer we can see Thee, may we reach out our hands, and find Thee leading us through death to immortality and glory.

[]

To the Christian, these shades are the golden haze which heaven's light makes, when it meets the earth, and mingles with its shadows.

[]

But whether on the scaffold high,
Or in the battle's van,
The fittest place where man can die
Is where he dies for man.

[]

To die would be an awfully big adventure.

[]

No man escapes Death. So Death must not be the enemy. Life must not be the prize. It must be the gameboard, on which Death teaches its savage lessons. You could heed those lessons, or ignore them, but never evade them.
Death, then, was the ally. Not to be sought, but heeded.

[]

It is only the dead who do not return.

[]

So fades a summer cloud away;
So sinks the gale when storms are o'er;
So gently shuts the eye of day;
So dies a wave along the shore.

[]

Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have.

[]

There is no harm in patience, and no profit in lamentation. Death is easier to bear [than] that which precedes it, and more severe than that which comes after it. Remember the death of the Apostle of God, and your sorrow will be lessened.

[]

The death-change comes.
Death is another life. We bow our heads
At going out, we think, and enter straight
Another golden chamber of the king's,
Larger than this we leave, and lovelier.
And then in shadowy glimpses, disconnect,
The story, flower-like, closes thus its leaves.
The will of God is all in all. He makes,
Destroys, remakes, for His own pleasure, all.

[]

Death is the universal salt of states;
Blood is the base of all things — law and war.

[]

Life hath more awe than death.

[]

Death, as the human consciousness understands it, pain and sorrow, loss and disaster, joy and distress, are only such because man, as yet, identifies himself with the life of the form and not with the life and consciousness of the soul...

[]

What then remains, but that we still should cry
Not to be born, or being born to die.

[]

It is as natural to die as to be born; and to a little infant, perhaps, the one is as painful as the other.

[]

The pomp of death alarms us more than death itself.

[]

I have often thought upon death, and I find it the least of all evils.

[]

It is worthy the observing, that there is no passion in the mind of man, so weak, but it mates, and masters, the fear of death; and therefore, death is no such terrible enemy, when a man hath so many attendants about him, that can win the combat of him. Revenge triumphs over death; love slights it; honor aspireth to it; grief flieth to it; fear preoccupieth it.

[]

Men fear death, as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other.

[]

Death is a friend of ours; and he that is not ready to entertain him is not at home.


[]

It is not death that a man should fear, but never beginning to live.

[]

Her cabin'd ample spirit,
It fluttered and fail'd for breath;
Tonight it doth inherit
The vasty hall of death.

[]

He who died at Azan sends
This to comfort all his friends:
Faithful friends! It lies I know
Pale and white and cold as snow;
And ye say, "Abdallah's dead!"
Weeping at the feet and head.
I can see your falling tears,
I can hear your sighs and prayers;
Yet I smile and whisper this:
I am not the thing you kiss.
Cease your tears and let it lie;
It was mine—it is not I.

[]

Your lost friends are not dead, but gone before,
Advanced a stage or two upon that road
Which you must travel in the steps they trod.

[]

Men fear death, as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other.

[]

The separation of the spiritual part of the soul from the earthly body does not essentially change that spirit. A person takes with him the sum total of the character he has formed up to that time. Mortal death does not make a person better or worse; it simply adds to him one more experience which, no doubt, has a teachable influence on him.

[]

Every breath you take is a step towards death.

[]

The white sail of his soul has rounded
The promontory—death.

[]

Somewhere, in desolate, wind-swept space,
In twilight land, in no man's land,
Two hurrying shapes met face to face
And bade each other stand.
"And who are you?" cried one, a-gape,
Shuddering in the glimmering light.
"I know not," said the second shape,
"I only died last night."

[]

But when the sun in all his state,
Illumed the eastern skies,
She passed through glory's morning gate,
And walked in Paradise.

[]

The Fear of Death often proves Mortal, and sets People on Methods to save their Lives, which infallibly destroy them.

[]

Call no man happy till he is dead.

[]

Death is a black camel, which kneels at the gates of all.

[]

Death gives meaning to life. Living in fear of death is living in denial. Actually, it's not really living at all, because there is no life without death. It's two sides of the one.

[]

Death is nothing but death, but it prevents life. If you are afraid, life has no value, and if you die, everything dies.
