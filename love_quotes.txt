It's odd to think we might have been
Sun, moon and stars unto each other--
Only, I turned down one little street
And you went up another.

...the mind of the lover abhors accident... surely it was lovers who discovered astrology... My love for Julian must have been figured before the world began... When God said, "Let there be light," this love was made.

Yet when I heard your name that first far time
It seemed like other names to me, and I
Was all unconscious, as a dreaming river
That nears at last its long predestined sea...

[]

There is a lady sweet and kind,
Was never face so pleased my mind;
I did but see her passing by,
And yet I love her till I die.

That beautiful pale face is my fate.

What was it that controlled me?
What kept my love-life lean?
My intuition told me
You'd come on the scene.

Crushes. I love crushes. There's always somebody new. You see someone handsome on the bus, fantasize, fall in love, then the bus stops and you get off. It lasts five minutes, then it's over—the perfect relationship. I don't have time for anything else.

'Love at first sight,' some say, misnaming
Discovery of twinned helplessness
Against the huge tug of procreation.
But friendship at first sight? This also
Catches fiercely at the surprised heart
So that the cheek blanches and then blushes.

[]

The heart has its reasons which the reason does not know.

[]

The woman who resembles us is antipathic: what we seek in the other sex is the opposite of ourselves.

[]

Love is but the discovery of ourselves in others, and the delight in the recognition.

Madam, I have been looking for a person who disliked gravy all my life; let us swear eternal friendship.

At Sunday dinner, with your defenses down
I fell in love...

It was the first time he had ever bought flowers for a woman, when he smelled them his chest swelled with pride, as though this tribute intended for someone else had turned back upon himself.

...Johnny had said when I first met him how he had always had, like, these problems with women, and at the time I dug him so much for saying that because I thought: aw, hey, this guy's just like me. Which is to say he lacked confidence in himself as a person. Or, to put it another way, he did not know who he really was as a man, just like I did not know who I really was as a woman. And so we could start from scratch, the two of us, and find out together.

Del Rosso insists upon a woman who... gives him the opportunity and incentive to display his particular brand of charm.

We are carefully watching each other,
We are prowling through casual speech,
We are drifting towards reefs through the smother
Of each one's awareness of each.
We are jockeying now for position,
We are dropping the duellist's glove,
We are tempting the cruel perdition
Of something called love.

Sometimes I think I must send out vibrations that say, 'calling all rats, calling all rats'!

Jeepers Creepers! Where'd you get those eyes?

I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
Them there eyes!

Glances are the big guns of the virtuous coquette; everything can be conveyed in a look, and yet that look can always be denied, because it cannot be quoted word for word.

Tell me, is there any part of me
That is not loveable?

She wasn't really a girl, not really quite human: how could she be? She was a position, a specific glory, a trophy, our local upper-middle-class pseudo Cleopatra.

She was proof of a level of sexual adventure I had not yet with my best efforts reached: that level existed because Orra existed.

People always stared at her. Some giggled nervously. Do you like me, Orra? Do you like me at all? They stared at the great hands of the Aztec priest opening them to feelings and to awe, exposing their hearts, the dread cautiousness of their lives.

...just to see her... offered some kind of encouragement, was some kind of testimony that life was interesting.

To see her in sunlight was to see Marxism die... Someone in actuality who had such a high immediate worth...

...here was the sort of... girl who could bestow indescribable benefits on any young man she liked—and on his confidence.

If the heart of a man is deprest with cares,
The mist is dispell'd when a woman appears;
Like the notes of a fiddle she sweetly, sweetly
Raises the spirits, and charms our ears.

Beauty is only the promise of happiness.

If, in the presence of women with feminine pride, you accept insults gracefully... the proud beauties are irked. They take you for a weakling, and soon begin to insult you themselves. These haughty characters practically throw themselves into the arms of men who are thoroughly intolerant of others. This is, I think, the only line to take, so that you often have to pick a quarrel with your neighbor to avoid one with your mistress.

Courtship is harder for men because they must show a proper blend of harmlessness and strength.

A prerequisite of love is that a man's face, at first sight, should reveal something to be respected and something to be pitied.

Complacency is in women as in beings of a lesser, perhaps, but finer and lighter species. What a delight to encounter creatures who have their heads always filled with dancing and whims and clothes! They are the charm of all over-tense and serious masculine souls, whose lives are filled with enormous responsibilities.

As you are woman, so be lovely;
As you are lovely, so be various,
Merciful as constant, constant as various,
So be mine, as I yours forever.

Woman is a miracle of divine contradictions.

[]

The core of the feminine mind, no matter how intelligent the woman may be, is occupied by an irrational power....The woman offers the man the magic opportunity of relating with another being without reasoning, of influencing, dominating, surrendering to another, without any reason entering into it.

Why do you always sit at the window? No doubt it makes a pretty picture but a girl walking in the fields also makes a pretty picture...

So bright the tear in Beauty's eye,
Love half regrets to kiss it dry.

A man wasn't bored with that girl, that's for sure!

The birds go to sleep by the sweet wild twist of her song.

Some women, in fact in my experience many women, have a sort of "abstract" quality about them. ...Perhaps this quality is really just unselfishness.

[]

Of praises sung of her she is aware,
Yet clad in sweet humility she goes.

Maidens' hearts are always soft...

She was terrified, shy, shamefaced, and therefore all the more charming.

Ursula, in a garden, found
A bed of radishes.
She kneeled upon the ground
And gathered them,
With flowers around,
Blue, gold, pink, and green.

O wild, dark flower of woman,
Deep rose of my desire,
An Eastern wizard made you
Of earth and stars and fire.

There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
At every joint and motive of her body.

...she laughed gaily with that delightful, deep laughter which was one of her chief charms.

[]

...there was an excitement in her voice... a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour... [Her voice] was full of money-- that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it... High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl...

And on the wing
Of her sweet voice, it shall appear
That Love can enter at the ear.

...how should I avoid to be her slave
Whose subtle art invisibly can wreathe
My fetters of the very air I breathe?

You can shine your shoes and wear a suit
You can comb your hair and look quite cute
You can wear a collar and a tie
But one thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside...

...you
Shine like an early drop of dew
Poised on a red rose petal.

Like the touch of rain she was
On a man's flesh and hair and eyes
When the joy of walking thus
Has taken him by surprise

[]

...she had the sparkle of a real diamond among paste.

[]

Thou art so very sweet and fair,
With such a heaven in thine eyes,
It almost seems an overcare
To ask thee to be good or wise.
As if a little bird were blam'd
Because its song unthinking flows;
As if a rose should be asham'd
Of being nothing but a rose.

She was so sad and serene, so sweet and yet so withdrawn, that Leon felt himself gripped by a kind of icy enchantment (charme glacial) in her presence, just as one shivers in a church when the fragrance of flowers is mingled with the coldness of marble.

Because of that great nobleness of hers
The fire that stirs about her, when she stirs,
Burns but more clearly.

She was a creature that did move more like the sphere
of Mars of Jove of Sol of Love or one more fair.

...a perfect beauty,
she has no blemish;
especially when she is laughing,
I always wish she would laugh again.

At fifteen, I was able to compose my eyebrows...

She is a beautiful stylish woman, the sort of woman you and I would never normally come within a hundred miles of...

...only God, my dear,
Could love you for yourself alone
And not your yellow hair.

Magic is tangled in a woman's hair
For the entanglement of male pride.

Chain me, chain me, O most fair,
Chain me to thee with that hair!

She opened her eyes, and green
They shone, clear like flowers undone
For the first time, now for the first time seen.

Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee,
The shooting stars attend thee;
And the elves also,
Whose little eyes glow
Like the sparks of fire, befriend thee.

The light that lies
In women's eyes,
Has been my heart's undoing.

From women's eyes this doctrine I derive.
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain, and nourish all the world.

Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me.

...one of the most instructive avenues for assessing human evolution would be to attempt a history of the feminine types which have successively been preferred.

I found her slightly sluttish unkempt shabbiness physically attractive.

Robes loosely flowing, hair as free:
Such sweet neglect more taketh me
Than all th'adulteries of art.

Salome always looks for a man who is so different from other men that he seems almost to belong to an unknown sex.

I can't abide men who aren't good-looking.

The type of human being we prefer reveals the contours of our heart... By observing our neighbor in love we are able to deduce his vision or goal in life. And this is the most interesting thing to ascertain: not anecdotes about his existence, but the card upon which he stakes his life.

The ever-lit lamp of the evangelical virgins is the symbol of this virtue which constitutes, as it were, the threshold of love.

Like a sailor in distress, she kept scanning the solitude of her life with anxious eyes, straining to sight some far-off white sail in the mists of the horizon.

One feels desire before knowing the person or situation that satisfies it.

Poor is the life that misses
The lover's greatest treasure,
Innumerable kisses
Which end in endless pleasure.
Oh, then, if this be so,
Shall I a virgin die? Fie no!

...I then felt free to fall in love...

He's just played the tyrant for too long. I must have new love.

An absence of mistrust is not enough; there must be a weariness of mistrusting, and, as it were, courage must be impatient with the hazards of life. You are unconsciously bored by living without loving...

In the unattached heart of a girl who is living in a secluded chateau in the depths of the country, the least touch of surprise arouses profound interest.

In Rome, where day-to-day events provide so little interest, and where outer existence is so lethargic, sensibility accumulates to the benefit of the passions.

For love to assume its full stature in the heart of man, it [is] necessary that the greatest possible equality should be established between the mistress and her lover.

[Consider] the Benou-Azra, a tribe famous for love throughout all the tribes of Arabia. Their way of loving has become a byword, for God never made other creatures who loved so tenderly.

In Italy, since passion is not infrequent it is not ridiculous and one hears generalizations about love freely quoted in drawing-rooms.

There are many people who would never have been in love if they had never heard love spoken of.

What she felt she could not find words to tell, for she was only a simple girl reared in the fields, and never in her life had ever heard the word: love.

Yesterday evening I heard two delightful little girls of four singing some very lively love-songs as I pushed them in their swing. The chambermaids teach them these songs and their mother tells them that 'love' and 'lover' are meaningless words...

An honest farmer was complaining of damage caused in his orchard and I asked him why he did not keep a dog. "My daughters would never marry," was his reply, which I did not understand until he told me that once he had a dog so fierce that none of the boys ever dared to climb through his windows.

What did I know

able to go

All who joy would win
Must share it-- Happiness was born a twin.

My room was white with the sun
And Love cried out in me,
"I am strong, I will break your heart
Unless you set me free."

Prudishness is the worst kind of avarice.

A charming woman may... treat a man now with extreme coldness, because she is saving herself for a future lover whom she may never even meet. ...It is as if an orange-tree dared not flower for fear of committing a sin.

A great man is like an eagle; the higher he goes, the less you see of him, and loneliness is the price he pays for being great.

The majority of men... have little propensity for passionate love; it would disturb their delightful tranquility; I believe they would regard its transports as unhappiness; certainly they would be humiliated by its shyness.

Little boy, pretty knave, shoot not at random,
For if you hit me, slave, I'll tell your grandam.

I will humble my Beauty, I will not dress fine,
I will keep from the Ball, & my Eyes shall not shine;
And if any Girl's Lover forsakes her for me,
I'll refuse him my hand and from Envy be free.

When is man strong until he feels alone?

[]

I think that every intensely personal life has always had to isolate a fictitious personality, a kind of dermato-psyche to hold off and distract the hostile curiosity of inferior people, in order to be able, behind that bulwark, to devote itself freely to being what it is.

[]

I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.

Whilst I do keep
My harmless sheep
Love hath no power on me:
'Tis idle souls
Which he controls;
The busy man is free.

What a woman was there snatched by puritanism from love!

Never even to have touched
The hot blood
Of a soft body,
Doesn't it make you unhappy
You who preach morality?

[]

Oh, is it not enough to be
Here with this beauty over me?
My throat should ache with praise, and I
Should kneel in joy beneath the sky.
...O beauty, are you not enough?
Why am I crying after love?

[]

My heart, being hungry, feeds on food
The fat of heart despise.
Beauty where beauty never stood,
And sweet where no sweet lies
I gather to my querulous need,
Having a growing heart to feed.

'Passionate Love'

Most tender things speak in my heart
And I can only say them to the bamboos in the garden...

Let those love now who never loved before,
Let those who always loved, now love the more.

O Morning Winds that from the garden blow,
Should you meet one like me forlorn and sad,
On him bestow
The peace and solace I have never had.

For this will cure him that is sick, and raise him that is in dumps; one that has loved, it will remember of it; one that has not, it will instruct...
