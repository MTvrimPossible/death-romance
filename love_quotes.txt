There's beggary in the love that can be reckoned.

[]

Those his goodly eyes,
That o'er the files and musters of the war
Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn
The office and devotion of their view
Upon a tawny front.

[]

Moreover, the kiss, one particular contact of this kind, between the mucous membrane of the lips of the two people concerned, is helf in high sexual esteem among many nations (including the most highly civilized ones), in spite of the fact that the parts of the body involved do not form part of the sexual apparatus but constitute the entrance to the digestive tract.

[]

But well thou play'dst the housewife's part,
And all thy threads with magic art
Have wound themselves about this heart,
My Mary!

[]

The quarrels of lovers are the renewal of love.

[]

With hopes and with fears, like a ship in the ocean,
Our hearts are kept dancing and ever in motion;
When our passion is pallid, and our fancy would fail,
A little kind quarrel supplies a fresh gale...

[]

KOMET MY FAULT VANISH

[]

But love was still there, busily moving about inside what still seemed, at times, the awful mess of their damaged marriage.

[]

Among the pink and blue
Of the sky and the almond flowers
A sparrow flutters.
—We have come through...

[]

War is no strife
To the dark house and the detested wife.

[]

...I am paying for my particular kind of passion, which makes me see an angry Le'onore in the skyline of rocks at Poligny...

[]

I have become a prisoner,
I live like in a dungeon,
there is not even an opportunity
to ask your forgiveness.

[]

The experience varies with a traveller's age
And bodily strength, and strength of the love affair
That harries him out of doors in steady drizzle,
With neither jacket nor hat, and holds him there.

[]

My breath comes rapidly,
I can hardly breathe in or out.

[]

...all of a sudden in their very early days they had such a violent quarrel that she said to him that he did not love her, that he only loved himself. ...the agonizing feeling of division into two parts which he experienced at that moment.

[]

A real disease is better
than your angry moods.

[]

To be wroth with one we love
Doth work like madness in the brain.

[]

A woman must be a genius to create a good husband.

[]

No wish to die. One of the best of sports, which they all knew. This b—at Palmer's Green has sneaked my wife, one of the best in the world; my wife, the first love in the world.

[]

I can't live with him. To see him is torture to me.

[]

She would have made a splendid wife, for crying only made her eyes more bright and tender.

[]

I love your sad tenderness—when I've hurt you...

[]

O father! What a hell of witchcraft lies
In the small orb of one particular tear.

[]

To see stand weeping by
A woman once embraced, will try
The tension of a man the most austere...

[]

Where love has been prevented by too early a victory, I have noticed that in sensitive people crystallization tries to set in afterwards. The woman says laughingly, "No, I don't love you."

[]

In the length of time you have known her you will no doubt have learned which woman in the town or in society she fears and envies most. Pay your attentions to this woman, but do not broadcast the fact...

[]

...many women, merely angry with a man they still love, will attach themselves to a man of whom their lover shows jealousy, until suddenly the game becomes a reality.

[]

...those endless, circular debates about the possible intentions behind a remark...

[]

Their paths to this impasse defy analysis,
Save that the trivial now is grown so huge
As to induce in both complete paralysis
Of reason and resort to subterfuge.
Their burning wrongs sing ringing in their brains
The oldest and the dismalest refrains.

[]

Some prefer agitated love affairs as they prefer rough seas to calm ones...

[]

A good man pays his debts
But you ain't paid yours yet
It's time to even it
It's time to even it, even it up!

Opposition is true Friendship.

...when Johnny called me up later at work and bought the really lame excuse I gave him, I distinctly remember this voice inside my head whispering: Hey, Lucy. This guy is pathetic...

[]

If he were to kill me, if he were to kill Vronsky, I should respect him.

[]

Karenin simply did not wish to think about his wife's conduct and feelings and, in fact, he just did not think about them. ...[He] expected that this passion would pass as did everything in the world and that it would all be forgotten and his name would remain undisgraced.

[]

Oblonsky... had only vaguely imagined that his wife had long since guessed that he was unfaithful to her and preferred not to see what was going on.

[]

She is leaving you because she is too sure of you. You have removed fear, and the little doubts of happy love no longer occur; make her anxious...

[]

It was for him that she filed her fingernails with the meticulous care of an engraver, faithfully rubbed her skin with cold cream and scented her handkerchiefs with patchouli...

[]

Charles, rebelling against [his mother] for the first time in his life, came to his wife's defense; as a result, the elder Madame Bovary decided to go back home.

[]

...the letters she wrote to him were largely concerned with flowers, poetry, the moon and the stars—naive expedients of a weakened passion trying to stimulate itself by external means.

[]

Who promised love should be happiness? Nature may have some other end.

[]

Keep thy eyes wide open before marriage; and half shut afterward.

[]

Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more;
Men were deceivers ever,
One foot in sea, and one on shore,
To one thing constant never:
Then sigh not so, but let them go,
And be you blithe and bonny,
Converting all your sounds of woe
Into Hey nonny, nonny!

[]

I should forgive, and forgive just as if nothing had ever happened at all.

...when you love someone, you love the whole person, just as he or she is, and not as you would like them to be.

She felt in her heart that abject docility which, for many women, is both the punishment and expiation of their adultery.

[]

I agree to be punished,
in any way you like.
Even if you beat me I consent,
I will not dispute in any way,
because I have annoyed you
it is your duty to punish me.

[]

Keep your undrest, familiar style
For strangers, but respect your friend,
Her most, whose matrimonial smile
Is, and asks honor without end...

[]

Ah, love, let us be true
To one another!

[]

There are two kinds of faithfulness in love: one is based on forever finding new things to love in the loved one; the other is based on our pride in being faithful.

[]

Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds.

[]

The way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost.

[]

Love not me for comely grace,
For my pleasing eye or face,
Nor for any outward part
No, nor for my constant heart:
For those may fail or turn to ill,
So thou and I shall sever.
Keep therefore a true woman's eye,
And love me still, but know not why;
So hast thou the same reason still
To doat upon me ever.

[]

I love him not as hee is now,
but as hee was before.

One flatters women at twenty, abandons them at forty.

And an inner voice told him that it was impossible to patch up or put right their relationship because it was impossible to make her attractive and desirable again or turn him into an old man incapable of love.

When poverty comes in at doors,
Love leaps out at windows.

Frankie got down from that high stool
She didn't want to see no more
Rooty-toot-toot three times she shot
Right through that hardwood door.
He was her man,
But he done her wrong.

[]

To appreciate heaven well
'Tis good for a man to have some fifteen minutes of hell.

Once I had a love, and it was a gas
Soon to find out, I had a heart of glass

One is easily fooled by that which one loves.

[]

The story of Mlle. de Somnery is well known in France; how, surprised in flagrante by her lover, she boldly denied the whole thing. When he pressed her, she cried: "Oh, I see it all now. You don't love me any more; you'd rather believe your own eyes than what I tell you!"

[]

...we only want jealousy in people of whom we ourselves could be jealous.

[]

Spirited women... may be pleased by jealousy, as a new way of showing them their power.

[]

She wished he would beat her so that she could feel more justified in hating him and taking vengeance on him.

[]

It is better to have a prosaic husband and to take a romantic lover.

[]

For whom was she being virtuous? Was he not the obstacle to any kind of happiness, the cause of all her misery, the sharp-pointed tongue in the buckle of the strap that wound around her, binding her on all sides?

[]

...as soon as a prince came to court she would send her duke packing.

[]

Cupid's curse,—
They that do change old love for new,
Pray gods they change for worse.

[]

There are less than twenty varieties of womankind, and once one has sampled two or three of each variety, one begins to grow sated.

[]

...he talks about me to other women, I know he does, he confides in other women and discusses me with them.

[]

We are ashamed to admit that we are jealous, yet we pride ourselves on having been jealous, and on being capable of jealousy.

[]

Nor jealousy
Was understood, the injured lover's hell.

[]

...being jealous, Anna was indignant with him and was constantly seeking reasons to justify her indignation.

[]

...to allow so pretty a woman to go out by herself in Paris was just as rash as to leave a case filled with jewels in the middle of the street.

[]

Trifles light as air
Seem to the jealous. confirmations strong
As proofs from holy writ.

[]

...the attraction which her body held for them had aroused in him a painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest particles of her heart.

[]

If one had the most precious diamond in the world in your pocket wouldn't you be afraid of losing it, wouldn't you keep putting your hand in to be sure it was still there?

[]

And suddenly a strange idea crossed her mind: what if he did not love her any more? ...She drank in eagerly the assurances of love, which he thought so vulgar he was ashamed to utter them...

[]

The most neglected mistress, once she shows a preference for another man, robs us of all peace and stirs our hearts into something very like passion.

[]

Here's to woman! Would that we could fall into her arms without falling into her hands.

[]

I'd like to know if all I'm feeling is normal.

[]

Each man kills the thing he loves.

[]

...sometimes what we do [for love] could be mistaken for the work of hatred.

[]

Instead of enjoying the expressions of their lovers' affection, women [of pride] grow conceited, and when they do fall in love, however sensitive they may have been before, they have nothing left but vanity.

[]

...thence is my greefe for nature whyle she strove
with all her graces and devinest arte
to forme her to to bewtyfull of hew

[]

Loving a proud girl,
I tell you, contains disaster.

[]

The love bestowed on the great
Is ever full of toil and cares

[]

When I fell in love, I wasn't really happy. I felt myself becoming less and less my own self and more and more and more a part of him... I didn't want to be enveloped.

[]

Although I find that I'm funny, sarcastic, and energetic when in mixed groups, 'the life of the party'—when my boyfriend's there... boom. I'm very quiet.

[]

No matter how free and strong you are, when you are with a man, you start thinking how he feels, [you] lose any self, any center.

[]

You never wanted to know what happened to me except in relation to you.

[]

[Men] have no interest in how I feel and what I need.

[]

One should always be in love. That is the reason one should never marry.

[]

Time, which strengthens friendship, weakens love.

[]

The boredom of married life is inevitably the death of love whenever love has preceded marriage.

[]

There are men you marry
And it's so boring
There are those you don't marry
And love grows.

[]

His raptures had settled into a regular schedule; he embraced her only at certain hours.

[]

I have trouble... because I don't seem to get involved with the verbal, expressive type.

[]

We just can't seem to be ourselves with each other.

[]

What he did not understand was why she should make such a fuss over such a simple thing as a love affair.

[]

The loves of two people, even as they love each other, are seldom the same.

[]

I knew it was that you forgot!
But all the same, deep in her heart
Rankled this thought, and rankles yet:
When love is at its best one loves
So much that he cannot forget.

[]

A woman is more responsive to a man's forgetfulness than to his attentions.

[]

Too much faith is folly.

[]

It is the little rift within the lute,
That by and by will make the music mute,
And ever widening slowly silence all.

[]

Let not the darkness dim
Fall like a curtain 'twixt thy soul and Him.

[]

...can wee soe farr straye to becom less
Circular then wee are now...

[]

He saw that the innermost recesses of her heart, always before open to him, were now closed against him.

[]

Alas! that neither bonds nor vows
Can certify possession;
Torments me still the fear that love
Died in its last expression.

[]

What drives me crazy in the relationship is not knowing... if he really loves me, if he wants to marry me eventually, if he is just going along... taking me for a joyride...?

[]

Goodness, why are his ears like that?

[]

Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,
He would have written sonnets all his life?

[]

If men knew how women pass the time when they are alone, they'd never marry.

[]

Then each applied to each that fatal knife,
Deep questioning, which probes to endless dole.
Ah, what a dusty answer gets the soul.
When hot for certainties in this our life!
...We are betrayed by what is false within.

[]

Love is not what you dream.

[]

Marriage is a romance in which the hero dies in the first chapter.

[]

Love is the child of illusion, and the parent of disillusion.

[]

...there were no such attributes in Annie Hovenden as his imagination had endowed her with.

[]

At every step he found that he was disappointed in his former dreams...

[]

When a Man has Married a Wife, he finds out whether
Her knees and elbows are only glued together.

[]

...however submissive a slave may be, her company soon grows burdensome.

[]

If one is sure of a woman's love, one looks to see whether she is beautiful or not; if one is doubtful of her heart there is no time to inspect her face.

[]

The accepted and betrothed lover has lost the wildest charm of his maiden in her acceptance of him. She was Heaven whilst he pursued her as a star; she cannot be Heaven if she stoops to such a one as he.

[]

Lest too light winning
Make the prize light.

[]

Disdain me still, that I may ever love,
For who his love enjoys, can love no more...

[]

We love only what we do not completely possess.

[]

...he had not ...by his jealousy, given her the proof that he loved her too much, which, between a pair of lovers, forever dispenses the recipient from the obligation to love enough.

[]

The duration of passion is proportionate with the original resistance of the woman.

[]

You can't expect me to keep up that level of charm—I'd have a heart attack!"

[]

The chase—men are used to it—but once they 'catch' someone, they don't know what to do.

[]

...that was before we got married.
—Before we drained out one another's force
With lies, self-denial, unspoken regret
And the sick eyes that blame; before the divorce
And the treachery.

[]

He that hath a wife and children hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief.

[]

Marry in haste, repent at leisure.

[]

Needles and pins, needles and pins,
When a man marries his troubles begin.

[]

The child is neither the father's nor the mother's: he is the personified union of the two and is a striving for perfection modeled after flesh and soul.

[]

Fair or foul—on land or sea—
Come the wind or weather,
Best or worst, whate'er they be,
We shall share together.

[]

Ho, love, I laugh aloud for love of you,
Glad that our love is fellow to rough weather,—
No fretful orchid hothoused from the dew...

[]

In the year that's coming on, rich in joy and sorrow,
We shall light our lamp, and wait life's mysterious morrow.

[]

...tears, —yes; and the ache here in the throat,
To know that I so ill deserve the place
Her arms made for me...

[]

...he heard the sound of very, very rapid light footsteps over the parquet floor, and his happiness, his life, his own self—his better self, which he had sought and yearned for for so long—came rapidly toward him.

[]

So, I shall see her in three days
And just one night, but nights are short,
Then two long hours, and that is morn.
See how I come, unchanged, unworn—
Feel, where my life broke off from thine,
How fresh the splinters keep and fine,—
Only a touch and we combine!

[]

The closer he came to his goal, the more his heart became drunk with Layla's scent, the louder his ears perceived the sound of her voice, the clearer his eyes recognized her face in mountains and valleys.

[]

Go faster! Use the reins and whip!
Bring me to Pompeii, where my sweet Love lies!

[]

...the most intoxicating romance in the lover's library, the railway timetable...

[]

Absence lessens half-hearted passions, and increases great ones, as the wind puts out the candle and stirs up the fire.

[]

I wondered with anguish whether I would ever see her again...

[]

Someone has instilled in you a mistrust of my words and feelings; everything seems suspicious to you—and there's nothing I can do about it, nothing at all.

[]

Will I see you
In September
Or lose you
To a summer love?

[]

A flame burns in my heart, a flame beyond measure, which has turned my being to ashes... His heart had suffered shipwreck... everything that binds human beings had fallen away from him... He was a prisoner in the land of love, and no one could bring him back.

[]

I am yours, however distant you may be!
Your sorrow, when you grieve, brings grief to me.
There blows no wind but wafts your scent to me,
There sings no bird but calls your name to me.
Each memory that has left its trace with me
Lingers for ever, as if part of me.

[]

[Antony] had frequently at the public audience of kings and princes received [from Cleopatra] amorous messages written in tablets made of onyx and crystal...

[]

...the first glance to see how many pages there are, the second to see how it ends, the breathless first reading, the slow lingering over each phrase and word, the taking possession, the absorbing of them, one by one, and finally the choosing of the one that will be carried in one's thoughts all day, making an exquisite accompaniment to the dull prose of life.

[]

I shall suffer very much if I don't get a line or a book from you from time to time, or some other proof that you think of me.

[]

And dost not thou think that to know particulars of thy health, and how thou spendest thy time, are pleasing subjects unto me, though thou hast no other business to write of?

[]

Born of pain and longing, their song had the power to break the unhappiness of the world.

[]

Judge not my passion by my want of skill:
Many love well, though they express it all;
And I your censure could with pleasure bear,
Would you but soon return, and speak it here.

[]

Exiled in some brilliant salon, I used to watch the magnificent clock for the exact moment when she would be leaving her lodging on foot, even in the rain, to visit her friend.

[]

When the clock strikes midnight, think of me!

[]

...it seems no less
Than that all circling winds and waters press
To bring me tidings how your life is led;
And I could hear the whisper of your name
Around the world...

[]

If a gust of wind sweeps by, or a cloud sails past in the sky, he believes them to be greetings from her and he thinks he can inhale her scent. He recites his poems, hoping that the wind or a cloud will carry them along to his beloved.

[]

If, in the distance, he espied tents and campfires, he was attracted like a night-moth, as if they were secret signs sent out by his beloved.

[]

All I now ask of Providence is, to vouchsafe me strength enough to reach her presence, and after that, to dispose as it pleaseth of my future fate, and of my life itself. Beyond that, I have no prayer to utter.

[]

Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered for your touch
a long, lonely time.
Time goes by so slowly and time can do so much,
are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love,
God speed your love to me!

[]

Darling, be home soon.

[]

Would that I could learn to fly and come to you and make obeisance to you.

[]

Western wind, when wilt thou blow,
That the small rain down can rain?
Christ, if my love were in my arms
And I in my bed again!

[]

Blow, northern wynd,
Send thou me my sweeting

[]

Would God that it were holiday!
That with my Love I might go play;
With woe my heart is weary;
My whole delight is in her sight,
Would God I had her company
Her company...

[]

What shall I do with all the days and hours
That must be counted ere I see thy face?
How shall I charm the interval that lowers
Between this time and that sweet time of grace?

[]

When stars are in the quiet skies,
Then most I pine for thee;
Bend on me then thy tender eyes,
As stars look on the sea.

[]

...when every morning I wake up, I look for you, it seems to me that half of myself is missing...

[]

See that building, which, when my mistress living
Was pleasure's essence,
See how it droopeth, and how nakedly it looketh
Without her presence...

[]

...often absences
Withdrew our souls, and made us carcasses.

[]

O you who on the road of Love pass by,
Attend and see
If any grief there be as heavy as mine.
Hear me and then consider: am not I
The keep and key
Of all the torments sorrow can combine?

[]

...he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles.

[]

He evoked her presence with all the strength of his desire and his memories.

[]

Le'on now seemed taller, handsomer, more charming, less distinct, although he was separated from her, he had not left her: he was still there, and everything in the house seemed to retain his shadow.

[]

That sweet thought which love oft sends me.

[]

...the constant thought of Odette gave the moments during which he was separated from her the same peculiar charm as those in which she was at his side. ...like a pet animal... he would stroke and fondle it, warm himself with it...

[]

...he felt so restless without her and so impatient a desire for the time to pass quickly till next morning when he would see her again and have her as his own forever, that he dreaded like death the fourteen hours which he would have to spend without her.

[]

Only last night
I saw my darling;
Why should I long for her
Again this morning?

[]

When we are parted, let me lie
In some far corner of thy heart,
Silent, and from the world apart,
Like a forgotten melody.

[]

Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

[]

My Love bound me with a kiss
That I should no longer stay;
When I felt so sweet a bliss
I had less power to part away...

[]

Kiss me and take my soul in keeping,
Since I must go, now day is near.

[]

It was a strong hour the hour of his departure!

[]

Fair, gentle lover, how ill you endure
your great ache for me, out on the salt sea...

[]

Layla's parents kept their daughter at home. They guarded her carefully and saw to it that Qays [Majnun] had no chance to meet her. They kept the new moon hidden from the fool...

[]

Yet this inconstancy is such
As thou too shalt adore;
I could not love thee, Dear, so much,
Loved I not Honour more.

[]

Love must have wings to fly away from love
And to fly back again.

[]

...he had to have an occupation and an interest apart from his love to help him refresh himself and have a rest from the emotions that agitated him so violently.

[]

Come, the wind may never again
Blow as now it blows for us;
And the stars may never again shine as now they shine;
Long before October returns,
Seas of blood will have parted us;
And you must crush the love in your heart, and I the love
in mine!

[]

I punch the clock, but it's okay
I love a girl who takes my breath away

[]

God be thanked, the meanest of his creatures
Boast two soul-sides, one to face the world with,
One to show a woman when he loves her...

[]

The assertion made by a happy marriage often alienates...

[]

I cannot stand the shows so instinctively put on by married people to insinuate that they are not only more fortunate but in some way more moral than you are.

[]

The woman's influence is, especially, atmospheric and, for that reason, ubiquitous and invisible.

[]

Love diminishes the delicacy of women, and increases that of men.

[]

He never argued against her ideas; he accepted all her tastes; he was becoming her mistress more than she was his.

[]

Levin had changed a great deal since his marriage; he had become patient... so many serious aspects of life had been revealed to him which because of his thoughtless attitude to them he considered unimportant before...

[]

A week ago; and it seems like a life,
and I have not yet learned to know myself:
I am so other than I was, so strange,
grown younger and grown older all in one...

[]

With how benign intent
Rememberest thou my breast,
Where thou alone abidest secretly,
And in thy sweet ascent,
With glory and good possessed,
How delicately thou teachest love to me!

[]

I got a brown skin woman
With her front teeth crowned with gold
She got a lien on my body
And a mortgage on my soul.

[]

I hunted you for my pleasure,
I caught you for my desire,
I bound you for my joy,
Your wounds have made us one.

[]

...the youthful spouse's need to take control, his reflective anxiety about the future, his calmingly classified commitment.

[]

Love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking together in the same direction.

[]

Lance would talk to me for hours about the plans he had to build a star-shaped house that he had designed.

I didn't know anybody who had dreams like that, and more than anything I wanted to live in his star-house with him.

He resembles George Harrison of the Beatles
(But he wears his hair
Tied in a small bow at the back).
I love him, but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him...

[]

Won't you come into the garden? I would like my roses to see you.

[]

...in new places the people we love appear to us somehow new, too.

[]

The moth's kiss first!
Kiss me as if you made believe
You were not sure, this eve,
How my face, your flower, had pursed
Its petals up; so, here and there
You brush it, till I grow aware
Who wants me, and wide open burst.

[]

A marriage is a very secret place.

[]

It's all a jungle—but maybe at least if you're married, it's a private jungle.

[]

By figuring on the ground,
I can draw a line to the stars;
Though intimate with her soft body,
I can't fathom my lover's depths.

[]

Whom we love best, to them we can say least.

[]

Doubt not our love—
A phoenix bird,
Which neither cries nor flaps its wings,
Yet is alive.

[]

Like man and wife who nightly keep
Inconsequent debate in sleep
As they dream side by side.

[]

Perfectly natural behavior and intimacy can exist only in passionate love, for in every other kind one is aware that a rival may be favoured.

[]

The more she got to know Vronsky, the more she loved him.

[]

He sat thinking and writing and all the time he never ceased for a moment being joyfully conscious of her presence.

[]

In Italy, one can always tell the beloved everything that comes into one's head; in fact one has to think aloud. There is a certain state of mind, resulting from intimacy and from frankness responding to frankness, which can only be reached in this way.

[]

About what affairs soever he go,
He must show her all his mind;
None of his counsel she may be kept fro,
Else is he a man unkind.

[]

Housepride may have contributed, at times, towards the saving of many women.

[]

And at night the Septette of Beethoven,
And grandmother by in her chair,
And the foot of all feet on the sofa
Beating delicate time to the air.

[]

He now savoured for the first time the ineffable delicacy of feminine refinements.

[]

No woman, no shed no tears
No woman no cry

[]

During her illness he had learned to know her thoroughly, to see into her very soul, and it semed to him that he had never loved her before.

[]

He reproached himself for having forgotten Emma {who was ill]... as though all his thoughts belonged to her and he could not stop thinking about her for a moment without being guilty of stealing something from her.

[]

For two weeks she didn't leave me for an instant. She didn't shut an eye all that time. She nursed me with a skill and devotion such as no woman has ever shown for the most loved of men!

[]

Button up your overcoat
When the wind is free
Take good care of yourself
You belong to me.

[]

Love does not "assume" responsibility. Love is responsible. This is its nature; it cannot be otherwise. When one is conscious of "assuming" responsibility, one acts dutifully, or conscientiously.

[]

Tell me something good
Tell me that you love me

[]

...and in her arms to forget all his cares.

[]

"Falling in love" ...has about the same relation to love as the idea for a story has to the ordeal of its writing. Every man is a hero far from the bayonet; every woman is a heroine of love until she starts practicing that arduous craft...

[]

Love is the flower, marriage is the fruit.

[]

To have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part...

[]

I am not worthy of you. You cannot possibly consent to marry me. Think it over. You have made a mistake.

[]

What they do in heaven we are ignorant of; but what they do not we are told expressly, that they neither marry nor are given in marriage.

[]

One should not think about it too much when marrying or taking pills.

[]

...all the women of the world
For you I will refuse.

[]

He had made up his mind from the very first to tell her two things, that he was not as pure as she and, secondly, that he was not a believer.

[]

By this confession [of the duration of my love] you will see I am past all disguise with you and that you have reason to be satisfied with knowing as much of my heart as I do myself.

[]

I've flung convention to the wind [in coming here to visit Anna], but other strait-laced people will give you the cold shoulder until you are married.

[]

We stood together, side by side, rooted
In the iron heart of circumambient hills,
Parents to a new age, weeping in awe
That the lot had fallen, of all mankind, on us
Now sealed as love's exemplars.

[]

It is impossible to repent of love. The sin of love does not exist.

[]

He who bends to himself a joy
Does the winged life destroy;
But he who kisses the joy as it flies
Lives in eternity's sun rise.

[]

He tried to force himself to stop loving her, but as soon as he heard her footsteps he would feel helplessly weak, like a drunkard at the sight of liquor.

[]

Majnun won fame as a lover, for he carried love's burden as long as he lived.

[]

Let those who talk, talk,
let them go on spreading rumors.
Why is our love so strange for them?
For me it is a miracle.

[]

Love laughs at locksmiths.

[]

We were young and gripped by the awful compelling force of physical love.

[]

And, though the sager sort our deeds reprove,
Let us not weigh them....

[]

A woman belongs by right to a man who loves her and whom she loves more than life.

[]

Where there is love there is no sin.

[]

Love knoweth no law.

[]

No, No! Go from me. I have left her lately.
I will not spoil my sheath with lesser brightness,
For my surrounding air has a new lightness;
Slight are her arms, yet they have bound me straitly
And left me cloaked as with a gauze of ether;
As with sweet leaves; as with a subtle clearness.
Oh, I have picked up magic in her nearness...

[]

Certain people who know that we are much together often insult me about you. I listen to them calmly, disdaining to answer them but their least word tumbles my heart about like a bird in a storm.

[]

Levin resented Dolly's remark. She could not understand how sublime and beyond her it all was, and she should not have dared to mention it. "She is a nice girl" were such ordinary, such common words, so out of tune with his feeling.

[]

Fatal passion! Have you yourself never felt its force? Is it possible that you, with the same blood in your veins that flows in mine, should have passed through life unscathed by the same excitements?

[]

...how strange it had seemed to think of [her] as a wife for anyone—his little daughter.

[]

In affairs of love, young people's hearts are generally much wiser than old peoples' heads.

[]

...the eternal bugaboo of respectable families: the shadowy, pernicious creature, the siren, the fabulous monster dwelling in the depths of love.

...the eternal bugaboo of respectable families: the shadowy, pernicious creature, the siren, the fabulous monster dwelling in the depths of love.

[]

God, how I live in misery
Since I'm beaten night and day
for my sweetheart's sake!
But the more my mother beats me,
the less will she ever take
my wild thoughts away!

[]

Leander's father knew where he had been,
And for the same mildly rebuked his son,
Thinking to quench the sparkles new begun.
But love, resisted once, grows passionate,
And nothing more than counsel lovers hate...

[]

He felt all the torment of his and her position, all the difficulty, exposed as they were to the eyes of the whole of the particular world in which they lived, of concealing their love, of indulging in lies and deception.

[]

And the gates of this Chapel were shut,
And 'Thou shalt not' writ over the door.

[]

Children of the future Age,
Reading this indignant page,
Know that in a former time
Love! sweet Love! was thought a crime.

[]

Did the others understand what they saw? Could they decipher the secret code of signs and glances?

[]

Who knows not how to conceal knows not how to love. Love disclosed seldom endures.

[]

...making [her husband] responsible for everything bad she could find in him, forgiving him nothing because of the terrible thing she had done to him.

[]

When she thought of her son and his future attitude to the mother who had given up his father, she was so terrified at what she had done that she no longer reasoned, but like a woman, only tried to reassure herself with false argument and words...

[]

...she was wondering why for others, Betsy, for instance (whose secret liaison with Tushkevich she knew about), it was all so easy, while for her it was so agonizing.

[]

Looking at him, she felt her degradation physically and she could not utter another word. He felt what a murderer must feel when he looks at the body he has deprived of life.

[]

In passionate love, intimacy is not so much the perfect happiness but the last step on the way to it.

[]

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new...?

[]

Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,
Flow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays;
My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream,
Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.

[]

I be her angel brightly a-drest,
Watche'n her slumber while she do rest.

[]

The whole world shines
I wish we could go on sleeping together,
Like this, to the end of eternity.

[]

What were all the world's alarms
To mighty Paris when he found
Sleep upon a golden bed
That first dawn in Helen's arms.

[]

Where had she learned that depravity, so profound and so artfully concealed that it was almost intangible?

[]

Hunger and anger of all being
Will wake again, and dark foreseeing.
Now these rest by murmuring springs
Of single blood that in them sings.

[]

Sex then reveals itself as the great connective principle whereby we overcome duality, the force which made separateness as an aspect of oneness at some moment of bliss in the mind of God.

[]

Four arms, two necks, one wreathing;
Two pairs of lips, one breathing;
Two hearts that multiply
Sighs interchangeably...

[]

When naked both, thou seemest not to be
Contiguous, but continuous parts of me:
And we in bodies are together brought
So near, our souls may know each other's thought
Without a whisper: yet I do aspire
To come more close to thee, and to be higher.

[]

What did your body say to mine
deep in velvet night's delight?

[]

What is sweeter than the human body?
Two human bodies as they rise and fall.
What is sweeter than two loving bodies?
There is nothing sweeter at all.

[]

There should between true lovers be
An excellent immodesty.

[]

A wise woman should never surrender for the first time by pre-arrangement—it should be an unexpected good fortune.

[]

Q: Is it good for romance to live together before marriage?
Barbara Cartland: No! No! No! ...a girl who sleeps about before marriage is putting her whole future in jeopardy.

[]

Keep on movin' in
Keep on tunin' in
Synchronize rhythms now...

[]

Crimond out of bed was not a kisser or cuddler. He did not waste the electricity of passion by continual contact.

[]

I belong still to your race
Of warm mouth and bone.

[]

Soul meets soul on lovers' lips.

[]

But my heart burnes; I cannot silent be.
Then, since, deare life, you faine would have me peace,
And I, mad with delight, want wit to cease,
Stop you my mouth with still, still kissing me.

[]

My soul, when I kissed Agathon, crept up to my lips,
As though it wished (poor thing!) to cross over to him.

[]

...this concentrated intensity of pure joy, this sudden white-hot rapturous pressure of lips upon lips, being upon being.

[]

...those two melting rubies...

[]

A kiss, when all is said, what is it?
...'tis a secret
Told to the mouth instead of to the ear.

[]

What is a kiss? Why this, as some approve:
The sure, sweet cement, glue and lime of love.

[]

Put your head, darling, darling, darling,
Your darling black head my heart above:
Oh, mouth of honey, with the thyme for fragrance,
Who, with heart in breast, could deny you love?

[]

Say I'm weary, say I'm sad,
Say that health and wealth have missed me,
Say I'm growing old, but add,
Jenny kissed me.

[]

I held Manon in such close embrace in my arms, that we occupied but one place in the coach.

[]

Then, like the moon which emerges from among the clouds, the concealed woman begins to radiate her hidden vitality and relinquish her fictitious countenance before the man.

[]

Does a woman live more acutely and completely in her body than a man does in his? Is she less divided than he? Less alienated from her body? Is touch more deeply experienced by her? ...In the night she awakens to kiss the flesh he touched, and to wonder.

[]

"I dearly love him, but I cannot bear to touch him." This is a denial of love, for love loves to touch.

[]

...the very essence of his being seemed to flow down into that moist palm.

[]

The greatest happiness love can offer is the first pressure of hands between you and your beloved.

[]

No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry anybody but you—and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me, either.

[]

You are mine, I am yours,
of this you must be sure.
You are locked
within my heart,
the little key is lost:
there you must remain for evermore!

[]

...you don't have to explain anything to each other, you guess each other's thoughts.

[]

Say thou dost love me, love me, love me—toll
The silver iterance!—only minding, Dear,
To love me also in silence, with thy soul.

[]

...enlightened by the deep intelligence of love.

[]

...the simplicity of gesture and bearing, the deep earnestness, the look which expresses the precise nuance of feeling so exactly and so candidly...

[]

Within my heart I feel Thy joy arise...

[]

Though Alps and Ocons bould devide
the shepeard from his sweetharts side
Love has a trick, a pritty Art
to Cary love from hart to hart...

[]

"You even resemble me, I feel I'm looking into a mirror." I had the strange feeling that as I was speaking these words I was speaking through her, through the pure echoing emptiness of her being hollowed by love.

[]

He maintained that he and Mme —were two souls quite outside the common run, who should understand each other at a glance.

[]

...feeling that she was looking at him, he turned around, smiling.

[]

Why did you not come to dinner? ...I'm astonished at the clairvoyance of lovers: she was not there.

[]

There was an hour
All still
When leaning with my head against a flower
I heard you talk.

[]

Love is an egotism of two.

[]

Nothing is as selfish as new love.

[]

Lovers who love truly do not write down their happiness.

[]

Jove send me more such afternoons as this.

[]

And lovely laughter leaps and falls
Upon their lips like madrigals.

[]

Love's greatest delight: that happy state of being perfectly natural with the beloved...

[]

Love has great sweetness
if it strikes both sides.

[]

Only to dance together in triumph of being together
Two white ones, sharp, vindicated,
Shining and touching,
Is heaven of our own, sheer with repudiation.

[]

I was made of honey and fudge and marzipan, and at the same time I was made of steel.

[]

I wonder by my troth what thou and I did till we loved...

[]

We are not the first,
people long ago began it.

[]

A lover cannot be sated by the enjoyment of the beloved.

[]

I believe myself that romantic love is the source of the most intense delights that life has to offer. In the relation of a man and a woman who love each other with passion and imagination and tenderness, there is something of inestimable value, to be ignorant of which is a great misfortune to any human being.

[]

A book of verses underneath the bough,
A jug of wine, a loaf of bread—and thou
Beside me singing in the wilderness—
Oh wilderness were Paradise enow!

[]

With thee conversing I forget all time,
All seasons and their change, all please alike.

[]

Nightingales in the plum tree,
Deer in the maples
Me and you:
fish and water.

[]

Your love pervades my body
As wine pervades water when
Wine and water mingle.

[]

There are two births: the one, when light
First strikes the new awakened sense;
The other, when two souls unite,
And we must count our life from thence:
When you loved me, and I loved you,
Then both of us were born anew.

[]

At the time when we come into the garden, thou and I...
The stars of heaven will come to gaze upon us...

[]

I feel shattered but at the same time I feel quite calm.

[]

...slip
Into my bosom and be lost in me.

[]

I am in your clay.
You are in my clay.

[]

Yet everything that touches us, you and me,
takes us together as a bow's stroke does,
that out of two strings draws a single voice.

[]

Has not the old earth passed away from us? —are not all things new?

[]

But peace overflows from your heart into mine. Then I feel that there is a Now, and that Now must be always calm and happy, and that sorrow and evil are but phantoms that seem to flit across it.

[]

When he looked at her it often seemed to him that his soul rushed out to her, flowerd like a wave around the contours of her head and was drawn down into the whiteness of her bosom.

[]

We did not speak one word,
For the beating of our own hearts
Was all the sound we heard.

[]

Take my heart; I shall have it all the more;
Plucking the flowers, we keep the plant in bloom.

[]

Look through mine eyes with thine, True wife,
Round my true heart thine arms entwine;
My other dearer life in life,
Look through my very soul with thine!

[]

She could take the whole world and just put it away somewhere, on the other side of the door, and the world didn't matter anymore. The world could not touch us or tell us what to do or make us feel guilty about what we said or what we did.

[]

We find rest in those we love, and we provide a resting place in ourselves for those who love us.

[]

Thy mirror am I!

[]

the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses

[]

In the seventeenth century, the whole intent of lovers was said to be "to get babies in each other's eyes"; a "baby in the eye" is that diminished reflection of one's self in the iris on another's eye.

[]

How bold one gets when one is sure of being loved!

[]

Love keeps out the cold better than a cloak.

[]

With each other as beloved,
If only we sleep together,
Then, though like threshed reeds
Things go wrong, let them go wrong—
If only we sleep together.

[]

When two love one another,
they forget all their troubles,
they can do no wrong in each other's eyes,
their love always wins.

[]

When you are combing your hair,
tying it up in a tuft for me,
I feel there is no dying,
when you come and talk about yourself.

[]

For thy sweet love rememb'red such wealth brings,
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

[]

True love makes a heaven of hell
True love makes a heaven of hell a heaven of Hell.

[]

It is a far cry from the man who sadly reminds himself, "She hath forsworn to love" to the one who exclaims at the pinnacle of his happiness: "Come what sorrow can!"

[]

...before the prow
The gamesome foam goes dancing, and the wake
Grows white behind: so love and love's delight
Swelled to uplift me on their wide expanse,
While all the winds of promise blew me home.

[]

If your love is mine, I feel so uplifted and so determined that nothing can be degrading to me.

[]

...a fluid all-conquering confidence was still making me feel benevolent and full of power.

[]

Though it rains,
I won't get wet;
I'll use your love
for an umbrella.

[]

I feel I would like to give birth to him.

[]

He is a genius of love.

[]

Willie is my child, he is my father.

[]

I go about murmuring, 'I have made that dignified girl commit herself, I have, I have', and then I vault over the sofa with exultation.

[]

"What's the matter with him today? What does he look the conquering hero for?"...[He] had grown enormously significant and important in his own eyes...

[]

I believe the happiness of the Duke de Nemours, when Madame de Cle`ves confessed her love for him, was greater than Napoleon's at Marengo.

[]

Now sleep, and take thy rest,
Once grieved and paine'd wight,
Since she now loves thee best
Who is thy heart's delight.
Let joy be thy soul's guest,
And care be banished quite,
Since she hath thee expressed
To be her favourite.

[]

Now the whole damn bus is cheering
And I can't believe I see...
A hundred yellow ribbons round the old oak tree!

[]

I quake for wonder at your choice of me:
Why, why and why?

[]

Forget not, when the rest is wholly done
and all her splendors opened one by one
to add that she likes Henry,
for reasons unknown, and fate has bound them fast
one to another in linkages that last
and that are fair to see.

[]

Deep in my memory was graved the trace
Of all I suffered since I saw thy face;
But now, Beloved, thou hast come to me,
I have erased the record utterly.

[]

More tenderly perchance than is my due,
Your spirit sees into my heart...

[]

To you we thank, lovers that been here
That this man—and never for to twin—
Fortuned have his lady for to win.

[]

Nor yet I called her mine. How could I dare?
Mine as the sky the eagle's, when he floats
Amid its deeps! Mine as the sun of June
Is propertied by the cup he paints with gold,
Or morning by the birds, whose folded sleep
Her soft ray touches till it flower in song!

[]

Papageno: Pa- Pa- Pa- Papagena!
Papagena: Pa- Pa- Pa- Papageno!
Papageno: Are you all mine now?
Papagena: I'm all yours now.
Papageno: Now be my dear little wife!
Papagena: Now be my heart's delight!

[]

And she caught me in her arms long and small,
And therewithal so sweetly did me kiss,
And softly said, "Dear heart, how like you this?"

[]

We never would have loved had not love struck
Swifter than reason, and despite reason:
Under the olives, our hands interlocked,
We both fell silent:
Each listened for the other's answering
Sigh of unreasonableness—
Innocent, gentle, bold, enduring, proud.

[]

He turned his face away.
She bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls and whispered, "I—love—you!"

[]

After seven months of coldness as heartbreaking at the end as it was in the beginning, she said to him one evening: "Dear Joseph, I am yours."

[]

Had they nothing else to say to each other? Yet their eyes were full of more serious talk, and as they forced themselves to find commonplace phrases they both felt the same kind of languor stealing over them; it was like a deep continuous murmur of the soul, dominating that of their voices.

[]

It's always been the same: it was settled by the eyes, by smiles...

[]

Lovers, rejoice! your pains shall be rewarded;
The god of love himself grieves at your crying...

[]

On the day when... she had gone up to him in her brown dress and silently given herself to him, on that day there took place in her heart a complete rupture with her former life, and a completely new, different, and quite unknown life began for her...

[]

Perhaps she was impressed by the force of my love; being thus impressed is as good a cause of real love as another.

[]

You made me love you
(I didn't wanna do it, I didn't wanna do it)

[]

He loves thee well who makes thee weep.

[]

In his younger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he loves; later, the feeling that he possesses a woman's heart may be enough to make him fall in love with her.

[]

You think about him wanting you so much that he can say such things to you, and his desire for you becomes your desire for him.

[]

Some pray to marry the man they love,
My prayer will somewhat vary:
I humbly pray to Heaven above
That I love the man I marry.

[]

Love can refuse love nothing.

[]

This second crystallization is almost entirely lacking when love is inspired by a woman who yields too soon.

[]

...if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo...

[]

...she would never tell him until the last minute whether she would be able to see him, for, counting on his always being free, she wished first to be certain that no-one else would propose coming round.

[]

O tell me tell me
that you soe roughly tumble me downe,
as if you meant to kill me...

[]

[When she went out on a date] there would be an air, in spite of her gaiety, of the captive about her.

[]

Did Crystal herself realize what her marriage would involve?

[]

You may do in the dark
What the day doth forbid...

[]

I only know
If a man loves me I love him,
If he dislikes me I dislike him.

[]

I felt so often my love just irritated you.

[]

I cannot ask her to be my wife just because she cannot be the wife of the man she wanted.

[]

In love, there is always one who kisses and one who offers the cheek.

[]

Without that visit... I would not have let myself believe in her interest, not felt again the complice beating of her heart with mine.

[]

And he's going to marry Mary Ann, that's me!
He's going to marry Mary Ann!

[]

I got her letter this morning. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't come to the office—I felt so happy—I just lay on the floor—I was simply bowled over by happiness—I could hardly breathe—I wanted to shout and sing but I felt too weak with joy—I just lay there as if I'd been mugged.

[]

She made me trust her, and this trust set loose a lion of desire.

[]

If thou dost Love
mee I Love againe.
If my greife move
I love my paine.

[]

For pity melts the mind to love.

[]

Yet of that treasure which at last they grant
None knows the value but the hearts who take;
The more hard-won, the more it doth enchant;
The prize, in love, is equal to the stake.

[]

It is my voice, mine, my own,
That makes you tremble there in the green gloom
Above me...

How happy's that lover, who, after long years
Of wishing and doubting, despairing and sorrow,
Shall hear his kind mistress say, 'Shake off thy tears,
And prepare to be happy tomorrow.'

[]

There was nothing physical between us, but I began to feel so certain that there would be, that I stopped worrying about it.

[]

[He had reached] ...the time of life... when a man can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting too much in return...

[]

I am the mistress of Prince von Schwarzenberg!

[]

My girl gave me her photograph,
shining with golden frame...
From dusk to dawn I kiss it,
and I keep it near me.

[]

But he wears a shabby hat, and she notices that he does not ride well. She tells herself with a sigh that she could never marry a man like that.

[]

...a woman who wishes to crush her lover's hopes should do so [at the earliest stage and do so] cruelly, and heap on his head, in public, insults which will make it quite impossible for him ever to see her again.

[]

Therefore depart, you shall not kiss me.

[]

The unkind woman may be accused of some embarrassing physical defect which it is impossible to verify; if the calumny could be verified and found true it would very soon be disposed of by the imagination, and forgotten.

[]

None alive will pity me.

[]

Bitterness is in my heart
causing my brain to flee.

[]

O wherefore shou'd I busk my heid?
Or wherefore shou'd I kame my hair?
For my true love has me forsook,
And says he'll never love me mair.

[]

Sometimes unto the mountain peaks he goes
Driven by his woes,
Sometimes within the barren wilderness
Hides his distress.

[]

...mine Eyes and Hart
outflow the Rivers, and out sigh the winde.

[]

Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep;
No drop but as a coach doth carry thee,
So ridest thou triumphing in my woe...

[]

...no sooner, in preparing himself for sleep, did he relax the self-control of which he was not even conscious so habitual had it become, than an icy shudder convulsed him and he began to sob.

[]

From the highest to the humblest scene of my life, from the brilliant world of fame to my own domestic hearth, you have poisoned all. I have no place of refuge: home is odious, the world oppressive.

[]

It is no use seeking consolation in pleasures of another sort; they turn to dust and ashes.

[]

The best of all things it were, never to be born,
Never to know the light of the strong sharp sun;
But being born,
The best of all is to pass as soon as may be
To Hades' gate,
there to lie dead,
Lost, locked close beneath the world's huge weight.

[]

You can't imagine what disgusting thoughts I have about everything.

[]

Yes, there is something repugnant and repellant about me.

[]

I can't bear to see the so-called eligible young men. I always imagine they are taking my measure.

[]

One solace I shall find, when I am over:
It will be known I died a constant lover!

[]

Since Destiny doth soe Ordaine
thy love shall not my life susteine
Death is lesse Dismall then Disdaine.

[]

In ancient times the Leucadian Leap was an apt image. It is, indeed, almost impossible to find a cure for love.

[]

Wherever the Beloved looks she stirs
Trouble and longing sore and eager breath
And deep desire in all her worshippers
And some for her have drunk the cup of Death.

[]

Yet many a man is making friends with death
Even as I speak, for lack of love alone.

[]

Away, delights! go seek some other dwelling,
For I must die.
Farewell, false Love! thy tongue is ever telling
Lie after lie...

[]

That if my Amoret, if she
In after-times would have it read,
How her beauty murder'd me,
With all my heart I will agree,
If she'll but love me, being dead.

[]

Then, everlasting Love, restrain thy will,
'Tis god-like to have power, but not to kill.

[]

O you,
Who came upon me once
Stretched under apple-trees just after bathing
Why did you not strangle me before speaking
Rather than fill me with the wild white honey of your words
And then leave me to the mercy
Of the forest bees.

[]

And if I waste, who shall bewail my heavy chance?
And if I starve, who will record my curse'd end?
And if I die, who will say, "This was Immerito"?

[]

Good luck is for the wicked,
We good people are left with longing.

[]

...my fault no Other is then that I love.

[]

No fault is thine, Beloved, I do not blame thee,
Nor do I blame my rivals for their part,
I know my troubles causeless, yet I harken
To my unreasonable, doubting heart.

[]

I felt that if I could not build a pattern of at least plausible beliefs to make some just bearable sense out of what had happened I should die.

[]

Love stinks!

[]

I learned that... love was only the dirty trick that nature played on us to achieve the continuation of the species.

[]

Now I'm soulless. I am the spirit of apathy. What I don't care about could fill a cathedral...

[]

The saddest thing that can
befall a soul
Is when it loses faith in
God and woman.

[]

...he regarded a cold reception from Le'onore as a victory of prosaic and calculating natures over frank and generous ones. At such times he lost his faith in virtue and even in glory.

[]

What is the sweetness of love?
Tell me, gentle folk.
It is torment of the heart,
I will never love again.

[]

I do not wish to love again,
give me peace, O Giver.

[]

I am close to regretting,
ever making friends with you.

[]

I'm gonna harden my heart, swallow my tears
Turn and leave you here...

[]

...Swann felt a very cordial sympathy with the sultan Mahomet II whose portrait by Bellini he admired, who, on finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives, stabbed her to death in order, as his Venetian biographer artlessly relates, to recover his peace of mind.

[]

Fret on fond Cupid, curse thy feeble bow,
and those dull shafts that are so blunt, so slow,
I can't bee harm'd
my brest is charm'd,
proud Caelia's coynesse whom I woo'd in vaine,
makes mee resolv'd never to love againe...

[]

What is love, anyway?
Does anybody love anybody anyway?

[]

Cool your soul,
go wherever you like,
I will not bother you,
I will control my heart.
You and me, enough!
Yet I still love you.

[]

But I somehow kept blindly thrusting this temptation away. I would not let my life degenerate into madness.

[]

It is impossible to repent of love. The sin of love does not exist.

[]

Then gradually the face of the other Odette would reappear and rise before him, softly radiant...

[]

I shall never know that joy again, and it is through my own fault that I have lost it!

[]

Sighing deeply, I said to myself: 'One day, inevitably, even your most gracious Beatrice must die.' This thought threw me into such a state of bewilderment that I closed my eyes, and I began, like a person who is delirious, to be tormented by these fantasies.

[]

Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

[]

"I hate everybody, and you and myself," his eyes replied...

[]

Jodie, I would abandon this idea of getting Reagan in a second if I could only win your heart and live out the rest of my life with you, whether it be in total obscurity or whatever. 

[]

Jodie, I'm asking you to please look into your heart and at least give me the chance with this historical deed to gain your respect and love.
I love you forever. 

[]

Reconsider me...

[]

...kill rebels, proudly that resist;
Not those that in true faith persist
And, conquered, serve your deity...

[]

In hope I live, and have done long,
Trusting yet still for to obtain;
And sure, methinks, I have great wrong
If that I be not loved again.

[]

If only the heart had a cover
I would have opened it and shown you my grief,
and you would have known
that I am the one for you.

[]

...the anguish which he then felt, and against which Odette's presence, the joy of being with her, was the sole specific (a specific which in the long run served to aggravate the disease, but at least brought temporary relief to his sufferings)...

[]

...for weomen will yeild
when the right plannet reigneth.

[]

She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me.

[]

One way or another, I'm gonna get ya.

[]

'Tis enough—
Who listens once will listen twice;
Her heart be sure is not of ice,
And one refusal no rebuff.

[]

Although you are being disgraced,
my heart, you will not listen.
Whatever you are told,
you go on running to and fro.
You are jeered with shouts of ha! ha!
But you do not change your mind.

[]

An hundred thousand oaths your fears
Perhaps would not remove:
And if I gazed a thousand years
I could no deeper love.

[]

My only star,
Why, why are your dear eyes,
Where all my life's peace lies,
With me at war?
...Sunshine of joy,
Why do your gestures, which
All eyes and hearts bewitch,
My bliss destroy?

[]

Love is poison
a poison that kills.

[]

...I was in love with a man who didn't care a rap about me and... I'm dying of love for him...

[]

...the body, unless the emotions are simultaneously damaged, can scarcely be hurt; damage the emotions, and the entire structure, body and soul, suffers.

[]

The sun went in, a bleak wind shook the blossom,
Dust flew, the windows glared in a blank row...

[]

"Ah!" said Owen.
That little monosyllable was all he uttered; its tone seemed cold and unconcerned to an ear like Peter Hovenden's, and yet there was in it the stifled outcry of the poor artist's heart, which he compressed within him...

[]

I stood and saw my mistress dance,
Silent, and with so fixed an eye,
Some might suppose me in a trance.
But being aske'd, why?
By one that knew I was in love,
I could not but impart
My wonder, to behold her move
So nimbly with a marble heart.

[]

But if it be decreed i fall
grant yet one bone one boone is all
that you will me youre martir call.

[]

O cruel fancy so to betray me,
Thou goest about to slay me

[]

To the fair fields where loves eternal dwell
There's none that come, but first they pass through hell

[]

For every hour I feel my share
Of love increase, but life impair,
So that in short time there will prove
Nothing left of me but my love.

[]

Love is cutting my liver.

[]

It's like there are two categories of men—boring and interesting. But those who are interesting just go away.

[]

I must love her, that loves not me.

[]

She noo mwore [sic] thought upon my thoughts,
Than the high moon in the skies.

[]

...ye are mercyles.

[]

My precious one does not value me
but pretends to be impenetrable.

[]

Cold December dwelleth in her heart.

[]

Yonder lies the snow, but my heart cannot melt it.

[]

My great pain how little she regardeth!

[]

Levin used to start and grow red in the face every time he remembered the disgrace of Kitty's refusal.

[]

...for years afterward, that look so full of love which she gave him and which met with no response from him cut her heart with tormenting shame.

Gold is her only love and she cares little for verses and the gifts of genius.

So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

Lawyer: How would you describe your relationship with John Hinckley?
Jodie Foster: I don't have any relationship with John Hinckley.

[]

Lo here my doubtful doom I try:
Tell me, my sweet, live I or die?
She smiles. Ah, she frowns. Ay me, I die.

[]

I have the misfortune of BEING TOO GREAT AN ADMIRER OF MILADY L.

[]

...you do not deign to countenance the sentiments which give me the sad rapture of being
The most respectful servant
of your Sovereign Indifference

[]

I told my love, I told my love,
I told her all my heart;
Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears—
Ah, she doth depart.

[]

The course of true love never did run smooth.

[]

So when [Monsieur Rouault] noticed that Charles' cheeks turned red in his daughter's presence, which meant that one of these days he would ask for her hand, he pondered the whole matter in advance...

[]

I am a lamp, a lamp that is out,
I am a shallow stream,
In it are neither pearls nor trout,
Nor one of the things that you dream.

[]

[He:] "...you'll get my 'flu or whatever it is."
[She:] "I want your 'flu. I want you. I love you, viruses and all."

[]

I shall jump out of the car.

[]

Look in my eyes; my love is written there.

[]

Doubt that the stars are fire;
Doubt that the sea doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
But never doubt I love.

[]

See, see, mine own sweet jewel,
See what I have here for my darling:
A robin-redbreast and a starling.
These I give both, in hope to move thee—
And yet thou say'st I do not love thee.

[]

Undoubtedly those two years of unhappiness proved that the passion was true, and they would have engendered it if it had not existed so strongly in the first place.

[]

I can live only wholly with you or not at all—yes, I am resolved to wander so long away from you until I can fly to your arms and say that I am really at home...

[]

Success too easily won soon strips love of its charm; obstacles enhance its value.

[]

A long siege humiliates a man, but glorifies a woman.

[]

I think the sexual revolution which has freed women to have casual sex has also freed them from the option of not having casual sex.

[]

...only good-looking girls could afford to be good...

Girls liked him, and escaped easily from his clumsy longing.

...the charm of the seduction and the need to protect herself from it...

[]

...if [Vronsky] could have put himself in her family's place and learned that Kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her, he would have been greatly surprised and would not have believed it. He could not possibly have believed that what gave such great and genuine pleasure to him, and above all, to her, could be wrong.

[]

...in general men thought very little of seducing a girl.

The red-eyed elders watching, felt
the basses of their beings throb
In witching chords, and their thin blood
Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.

In the great majority of cases [of physical attraction], sexuality is supported and complicated by germs of sentimental ardor, of admiration for physical beauty, sympathy, etc.

O rare! I caught a sight of the inwards of his garment, and took the flame.

If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby?

Some lads there are, 'tis shame to say,
That only court to thieve,
And once they bear the bloom away
'Tis little enough they leave.

[]

Perhaps women... imagine that their lovers in trying to win them are seeking to satisfy a point of vanity.

[]

Love, love, love—all the wretched cant of it, masking egotism, lust, masochism, fantasy under a mythology of sentimental postures.

[]

Women have been given a sensitivity to the nuances of affection, the most imperceptible variations of the human heart, the lightest movements of self-love.

[]

In such a night
Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well,
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,
And n'er a true one.

Ah, ah the falce fatall tale I read,
when my hart Heedless and unwise

on th'unknowne texte of thy lov'de Eyes...

For women, frankness is like going out unclothed.

[]

There exists... a pre-established harmony between woman and man; for the former, living means surrender, for the latter, living means taking possession...

[]

To you men, who are free to choose whom you like, it's always clear when you love. But a girl in a state of suspense... may and sometimes does feel that she does not know what to say. ...she can only answer yes or no.

[]

The young wolves snarl,
They snap at one another
Under the moon.
'Beasts, be reasonable,
My beauty is my own!'

To say why gals act so or so,
Or don't, 'ould be persumin';
Mebby to mean yes an' say no
Comes nateral to women.

Actions of women, by affection led,
Must backward, like the sacred tongue, be read.

[]

She half consents, who silently denies.

[]

And am I to blame? Have I done anything wrong? People say I'm just flirting with him, but I know that I don't love him. All the same I enjoy being with him and he's so nice...

[]

Women of pride... think themselves fortresses besieged by their lovers...

[]

Should we beware
Of handling such intemperate shaggy creatures
As leap on us like dogs to be cosseted
And, after, claim full rights of jealousy?

[]

...no woman ever fell in love with Napoleon, the master of the world. They all felt restless, out of sorts, and ill at ease near him...

We might make mistakes and choose wrong. Unhappiness was real. It was even likely.

I shall not read this letter of which I have seen only the signature; I shall burn it.

You work too hard to take this abuse
Be on your guard, jerks on the loose!

[His thought-balloon:] She is obviously stunned by my devastating love-vibe.
[Her thought-balloon:] In thirty seconds, I will walk slowly to the phone and call the police!

Ma! He's makin eyes at me!

[]

...of all the winds that blow on love, none is so chilling and destructive as a request for money.

[]

[My mother] and my sister would label my sister's suitors: one or two had family, one had money, one—a poor boy—had a brilliant future, and there were a few docile, sweet ones who were simply fillers, who represented the additional number of dates that raised my sister to the rank of a very popular girl.

[]

Johnny couldn't believe that I had ever considered myself unattractive to men, and for the first time in my life, I couldn't either. And right about then, other guys started to pay attention to me at the office.

[]

Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.

[]

When someone tells you, over and over, that he loves you, that you're the most precious thing in his whole life, you lay awake at night beside him, crying, trying to find within yourself the qualities that he seems able to see so clearly, and at last you see them, too.

[]

All I could think was: is that me? Because, honestly, it didn't resemble me at all. But the more I stared at it, the more I saw that it did. It was as though I was seeing into my face for the first time.

[]

...those eyes clothe me with a shining crystallization; to them I am perfection itself; and best of all, whatever I do, whatever stupidity I happen to utter, I shall not cease to be perfect in the eyes of my handsome German...

[]

Anna was intoxicated with the wine of admiration she had aroused.

[]

Demonstrations of love are never altogether displeasing to women, and the most disdainful, in spite of all their coyness, reserve a little complaisance in their hearts for their admirers.

[]

I love men finding me beautiful and being excited by me...

[]

She was overwhelmed with rapture. Her heart was full to the brim with happiness. She had never expected that this declaration of love would have made so strong an impression on her.

[]

It was the first time Emma had ever heard such things said to her, and her pride, like someone relaxing in a steam bath, stretched languidly and thoroughly in the warmth of his words.

[]

Men who do not make advances to women are apt to become victims [of] women who make advances to them.

[]

And taking the acacia flower which she had in her mouth, she tossed it at me with her thumb, and it hit me right between my two eyes. Sir, that had an effect on me as if a bullet had hit me...

[]

Let not my beauty's fire
Enflame unstaid desire,
Nor pierce any bright eye
That wand'reth lightly.

[]

No art I used men's love to draw,
I lived but by my being's law...

[]

On top of old Smoky
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
From a-courtin' too slow...

[]

And the moment these words were uttered, both he and she understood that it was all over, that what should have been said would never be said, and their agitation, having reached its climax, began to subside.

[]

I should have kissed her if the rain
Had lasted a minute more.

[]

And then she wept
For fear the Lord would not accept.

[]

I experienced Julian. I cannot explain this. I simply felt in a sort of exhausted defeated cornered utmost way that she was.

[]

Love me for ever!

[]

What had become of his usually calm and firm manner and the carefree and tranquil expression of his face? Every time he turned to her, he bowed his head a little, as if wishing to fall at her feet, and his eyes were full of an expression of submission and fear. "I do not want to hurt you," his every look seemed to say, "I only wish to save myself, and I do not know how."

[]

Indeed I love thee; come,
Yield thyself up: my hopes and thine are one:
Accomplish then my manhood and thyself,
Lay thy sweet hands in mine, and trust to me.

[]

Claim it:
...the ebony ritual-mask of no
Cannot outstare a living yes.

[]

Talk to me baby, tell me lies
Tell me lies as sweet as apple pie

I saw no one but you, I admired no one but you, I want no one but you. Answer me at once, and assuage the impatient passion of
N.

[]

O Fate! Cruel Fate! grant me now either death or victory.

[]

Then crown my joys or cure my pain:
Give me more love or more disdain.

[]

Be white or black; I hate
Dependence on a checkered fate.

[]

Rosemary's green, diddle diddle,
Lavender's blue,
If you'll love me, diddle diddle,
I will love you.

Levin was wondering what the change of expression on Kitty's face had meant, at one moment assuring himself that there was hope and at another falling into despair and clearly realizing that it was madness for him to hope.

[]

...these things seem wondrous, yet more wondrous I,
Whose heart with fear doth freeze, with love doth fry.

[]

There was nothing physical between us, but I began to feel so certain that there would be, that I stopped worrying about it.

[]

May God bring those together
Who want each other's love!

[]

God grant some other love
Do not my love detain

...make us a perfect Gemini...

Venus... Open for me the gates of hope, do not let me wait and starve outside.

Waiting for a car on the hill...

O my Electra! be
In love with none, but me.

[]

I cry: 'Give not to these charming desperadoes
What was made to be mine.'

[]

I adore you darling,
I love everything about you:
Only, dearest, I deplore that glad eye of yours
So easily pleased with all manner of loathly
Collegians.

[]

I'll make a point
Of takin her away from you
(watch what you do, yeah)
The way you treat her, what else can I do?

[]

In spite of my rival's apparent good fortune, I felt with a rush of pride and delight that my love was far greater than his.

[]

If you want to wake up [a rival who's inattentive to his advantages], just betray your jealousy. You will then perhaps have the privilege of informing him how valuable is the woman who prefers him to you, and you will be the author of his love for her.

[]

...he could never summon up the courage to leave Paris, even for a day, while Odette was there.

[]

But when, like a work of art, a woman reveals the utmost refinement of charm, the most subtle grace, the most divine beauty, the most voluptuous intelligence, a common admiration for her is bound to unite, to establish a brotherhood.

[]

...nearly all the young men who danced at the Moscow balls [were] in love with Kitty...

[]

As if one had secretly sent one's servant to suborn the servant of the beloved.

[]

...the princess knew perfectly well that if her daughter were allowed to make friends with any man she liked, she might fall in love with someone who had no intention of marrying or who would not make a good husband.

He that would the daughter win
Must with the mother first begin.

He is met with indifference, coldness, or even anger if he appears too confident.

[]

Love has no choice;
when it seizes a man,
he will confess everything,
everything that was not done.

[]

A man in love cuts a poor figure in the drawing-room in the evening, because one can only exercise skill and power over women to the extent that one regards their conquest in the same way as a game of billiards.

[]

Annie! dearest Annie! thou shouldst give firmness to my heart and hand, and not shake them thus...

[]

Were you to break the vow we swore together,
The vow, I said, would break you utterly:
Despite your pleas of duty elsewhere owed,
You could no longer laugh, work, heal, do magic,
Nor in the mirror face your own eyes.

[]

You should never say "I love you" to a man unless he says it first. A woman taking the initiative in love is bound to end thinking her heart is broken.

[]

I do love you, I'm sorry, I do, I just love saying it, it's my song of praise to the world.... I do just love talking to you, talking's so natural, babbling's natural...

[]

...feelin proud
To say 'I love you' right out loud

[]

Those three little words...

[]

[Fighting over a slate] ...she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees until these words were revealed: "I love you".

[]

It is bizarre to respond to 'Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor her and keep her?' with 'Well, I'll try.' ...commitment is analogous to a statement of intention, not a prediction or piece of clairvoyance.

[]

I want to give my whole life to making you happy.

[]

She need not have one anxious doubt of me,
She need not fear my further wanderings—
How can I flee?
How can a bird escape, deprived of wings?

[]

That I shall love you always.
No matter what party is in power;
No matter what temporarily expedient combination of
allied interests wins the war;
Shall love you always.

your beloved L.
ever thine
ever mine
ever for each other.

She had a pretty gift for quotation, which is a serviceable substitute for wit.

I ask that God in justice punish me
With death, if my love waver and grow less;
Faithful am I indeed—
How can you comprehend such faithfulness?

[]

Wheresoe'er I am, below, or else above you,
Wheresoe'er you are, my heart shall truly love you.

[]

I will not change you for another,
such a thing I could not do.
My heart is a mountain,
which cannot be moved by folly.

[]

Lay thy sheaf adown and come,
Share my harvest and my home.

[]

I shall be the friend whom he will trust,
and I shall be the child whom he will teach,
and I shall be the servant he will praise.

[]

Whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.

[]

Put your hand on my heart, say that you love me as
The woods upon the hills cleave to the hills' contours
I will uphold you, trunk and shoot and flowering sheaf,
And I will hold you, roots and fruit and fallen leaf.

[]

Lo, here I yield my life, my love, and all
Into thy hands, and all things else resign...

[]

From gate to inmost shrine
This palace of my soul is utterly Thine.

[]

I am close to you and there is real speech between us.

[]

I can't waste this love, I can't, it mustn't be wasted, poured away upon the face of the universe.

[]

Birds do it, bees do it,
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

[]

Lady, we can have
the whole world's joy if we both love!

[]

Shells pair on the rock, birds mate, the moths fly double.
O it is time for us now...

[]

Were there but world enough and time
This coyness, lady, were no crime

[]

Life is so short, so fast the lone hours fly,
We ought to be together, you and I.

[]

Love is an ocean of emotions, entirely surrounded by expenses.

[]

At the idea of buying the present a lot of trembling came on.... It is I suppose a method of touching the beloved.

[]

...the moment when, as she received an offering from him, he might feel himself somehow transported into her presence.

[]

Using a program wrote, programmers at Chevron Oil stumbled on the largest prime number ever discovered. He hoped to impress a girlfriend, he confesses. "She didn't marry me, but now I guess I can ask again!"

[]

...he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to 'show off' in all sorts of absurd boyish ways...

[]

...those shining clever gentle eyes somehow, and from the very first moment, looked right into my soul and I felt myself known for the first time in my life.... Her presence made me rest, every muscle, every atom became quiet and relaxed.

[]

He did not frighten her at first with compliments. He was calm, serious and melancholy.

[]

Neither will I put myself forward as others may do,
Neither, if you wish me to flatter, will I flatter you,
I will look at you grimly, and so you will know I am true.

[]

I feel sorry for the man who marries you... because everyone thinks you're sweet and you're not.

[]

If he sing she must be in ecstasy; if he dance she must look at him with delight; if he speak of learned things she must listen to him with admiration.

[]

The whole art of loving seems to me, in a nutshell, to consist in saying precisely what the degree of intoxication requires at any given moment. In other words, you must listen to your soul.

[]

I shall whisper
Heavenly labials in a world of gutturals.
It will undo him.

[]

Among the mossy oaks now coos the dove,
And the hoarse crow finds softer notes for love.

[]

How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears!

[]

To speak of love is to make love.

[]

Sending you kisses through my finger-tips—
Lady, O read my letter with your lips!

[]

"[Whether I stay in town long] all depends on you," he said and was at once terrified at his own words.

[]

At a time when she thought he was a hundred miles away, she met her lover in a place where he was certainly not expecting to see her. She could not conceal her first impulse of joy, and the man was even more moved than she was...

[]

If, when he did at last speak to me, his first words had been: M'adorez-vous? in truth I should not have had the strength not to answer him: Oui.

[]

Oh, none but gods have power their love to hide;
Affection by their countenance is descried.

[]

Ah! how and by what means
Shall I let her know of my heart?
Words are too commonplace,
If I employed them, for the part.

[]

The firmest faith is in the fewest words;
The turtles cannot sing, and yet they love.
True hearts have eyes and ears, no tongues to speak,
They hear and see, and sigh; and then they break.

[]

Believe not him whom love hath left so wise
As to have power his own tale to tell;
For children's griefs do yield the loudest cries,
And cold desires may be expresse'd well.
In well-told love most often falsehood lies,
But pity him that only sighs and dies.

[]

Is it a result of modesty and its deadly tedium for some women that most of them seem to admire nothing better in a man than his effrontery? Or do they mistake effrontery for character?

[]

A maid in love grows bold without knowing it.

[]

...she felt that everything on her must be right and graceful and that there was no need to alter anything.

[]

...to dominate her thoughts completely... a simple game of blowing hot and cold, of solicitousness and disdain, of presence and absence is all that is required.

[]

...if he had come upon the little group he would have hastened away at once with studied indifference, satisfied that he had seen Odette and she him, especially that she had seen him not bothering his head about her.

[]

When I first meet them, I treat them almost with contempt. I'm rude... and I act indifferent, no matter what they're like. It's the first step in what I call Henry's heavy heartbreak technique. The next time I meet them I'm much nicer, and the third time I fall all over them, and brother, it works! By the third date they're ready to go for broke.

[]

She'll be
wrapped around my finger.

[]

The wise lover does not praise his beloved until he has won him.

[]

Disdain begets a suit, scorn draws us nigh,
'Tis cause I would, and cannot, makes me try.

[]

It's a funny thing about love
The more you need love
The less loveable you are...

[]

Follow love, and it will flee;
Flee love, and it will follow thee.

[]

Follow a shadow, it still flies you;
Seem to fly it, it will pursue:
So court a mistress, she denies you;
Let her alone, she will court you...

[]

He that will win his dame, must do
As Love does, when he bends his bow;
With one hand thrust the lady from,
And with the other pull her home.

[]

Love that's wise
Will not say all it means.

[]

Strephon kissed me in the spring,
Robin in the fall,
But Colin only looked at me
And never kissed at all.
Strephon's kiss was lost in jest,
Robin's lost in play,
But the kiss in Colin's eyes
Haunts me night and day.

[]

The more I love someone the faster they flee!

[]

The look of love alarms
Because 'tis filled with fire;
But the look of soft deceit
Shall win the lover's hire.

[]

Teach me a measure of casualness
Though you stalk into my room like Venus naked.

[]

We do not tremble except for ourselves, or for those we love.

[]

I know how furiously your heart is beating.

[]

Under floods that are deepest,
Which Neptune obey;
Over rocks that are steepest,
Love will find out the way.

[]

It cannot be borne,
One cannot shut love up in the heart—
So let my soul-thread
Break and scatter wantonly:
Let none be shocked by what I do.

[]

Were beauty, under twenty locks kept fast,
Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.

[]

The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.

[]

Yonder beyond all hope of access
Begins your queendom; here is my fronteir,
Between us howl phantoms of the long dead,
But the bridge that I cross, concealed from view
Even in sunlight, and the gorge bottomless,
Swings and echoes under a strong tread
Because of my need for you.

[]

He racked his brains trying to decide how to 'declare himself' to her; and, continually torn between fear of displeasing her and shame at his own faint-heartedness, he shed tears of despair and desire. Finally he began to make firm decisions: he wrote letters and tore them up, set himself time limits and then extended them...

[]

The more desperately a man is in love, the greater the violence he must do to his own feelings in daring to risk offending the woman he loves by taking her hand.

[]

Love is the state in which one qualifies for citizenship by being oneself.

[]

Love is ever the beginning of Knowledge as fire is of light.

[]

Forget not that no fellow-being yet
May fall so low but love may lift his head.

[]

Know that I love you, know that you are most dear
To one who seeks to know
How, for your sake, to confront his pride and fear.

[]

Reduce the tension and let the thing get more ordinary. That'll help the cure. Secret brooding always makes it worse.

[]

They do not love that do not show their love.

[]

It is the woman who chooses the man who will choose her.

[]

To the Stranger I recognized a long time ago. You on the
other side. I split We split apart Something stops us from
crossing that city street Yes I recognized you You're a part
of me I refuse to give into.

[]

The sorrow, the heart's hurt—
Words cannot render this.
I saw her so briefly,
The woman of my dreams.

[]

L'amour est une fleur de'licieuse, but one needs courage to pluck it on the brink of a dreadful precipice. Besides ridicule, love is always haunted by the desperate possibility that the beloved will forsake it, leaving nothing but a lifelong DEAD BLANK.

[]

I scare myself, thinking about you.

[]

A woman with eyes only for one person, or with eyes always averted from him, creates exactly the same impression.

[]

I'm not in love, so don't forget it,
It's just a silly phase I'm going through...

[]

Thrice toss these oaken ashes in the air,
Thrice sit thou mute in this inchanted chair;
And thrice three times tie up this true loves knot,
And murmur soft, she will, or she will not.

[]

For what is courtship but disguise?
True hearts may have dissembling eyes.

[]

...in love possession is nothing, only enjoyment matters.

[]

Where is thy heart bestowed? Where is thy liking?

[]

I could never never never tell my love.

[]

Thus, to prevent my love from being cruel,
My heart's the sacrifice, as 'tis the fuel...

[]

I'm probably not the kind of girl you think you like...

[]

It is only in books that a violent nature is attractive. (Not that I often behaved violently, but they could smell it.)

[]

'It's quite plain,' she thought, 'Mlle de C—once told me I was not pretty and that I had something imperious and repellent in my looks, and now to crown it all I have to be clumsy; he must certainly despise me.'

[]

Oh, cruel fountain whose waters have made him so beautiful, can you not make me beautiful, too?

[]

What is any man, that he dare ask for you?

[]

Joe had a girl once, whom he loved, and she left him. He took it pretty hard, but he suffered quietly. Only his closest friends knew, and I imagine they didn't know the whole story. I guess he decided he didn't want to feel that way again, at least not for a while. I hope I'll be there, if he ever changes his mind.

[]

Bid her come forth,
Suffer herself to be desired,
And not blush so to be admired.

[]

Honest women are averse to what is vehement or unexpected, even though these are the symptoms of passion; besides, vehemence alarms modesty and they recoil from it.

[]

If she never comes,
disgrace will come to me.

[]

Shyness is a proof of love.

[]

I loved thee, though I told thee not.

[]

Whom we love best, to them we can say least.

[]

The fountains smoke, and yet no flame they show;
Stars shine by night, though undiscerned by day;
And trees do spring, yet are not seen to grow;
And shadows move, although they seem to stay:
In Winter's woe is buried Summer's bliss,
And Love loves most when love most secret is.

[]

In my breast
A pained flame burns
But no smoke rises,
so no one knows.

[]

Not the bottomless deep
Makes any noise;
It is in the shallows
Of a mountain brook
That idle ripples rise.

[]

Yes, I have a sort
Of rough and ready soldier's tongue. I know that.
But with any woman—paralyzed,
Speechless, dumb. I can only look at them.

[]

Of course I tore up all those letters, they were just for private self-expression.

[]

Never seek to tell thy love
Love that never told can be,
For the gentle wind does move
Silently, invisibly.

[]

And that tame Lover who unlocks his heart
Unto his mistress, teaching her an art
To plague himself, shows her the secret way
How she may tyrannnize another day!

[]

The slave in private only bears
Your bondage, who his love conceals;
But when his passion he declares,
You drag him at your chariot-wheels.

[]

Ah, my dear, don't have an affair with Fabrio Vitteleschi; far better fall in love with a highway assassin. With his gentle and measured ways he's quite capable of stabbing you to the heart with a dagger, and saying with a smile as he drives it into your breast, "Does it hurt, my little one?"

[]

Perhaps the wisest thing is to confide [only] in oneself. ...including all the relevant details, write down tonight what took place between you and your mistress, and the problems with which you are faced. If you are suffering from passionate love, in a week's time you will be someone else entirely, and then, reading your case-history, you will be able to give yourself good advice...

[]

Why oh why oh why had I broken my silence, I had given away my only treasure and I had given it to a fool.

[]

There is no indiscretion more quickly punished than to tell an intimate friend about your passionate love. Your friend knows that if what you say is true your pleasures are a thousand times greater than his, and that you must be scornful of his.

[]

In one thing my reason serves me:
Never man has asked me my delight
But I have purposely replied him false.
To me it seems no proper doctrine,
But rather folly or a childish act,
That he who is well treated in his love
Should to another man confide his heart
Unless that man can help or save him.

[]

A man can hide all things, excepting twain—
That he is drunk, and that he is in love.

[]

I, who did make her blush when I was named.

[]

...on receiving her branch he pressed it to his heart with so comical a gesture that all the Italians began to laugh.

[]

Well, I went down to Hammond
I did as I pleased
I'm not the only one
Who's got this disease...

[]

I have seen some of the best women merely passing the time of day with an intelligent man... while at the same time, and indeed almost in the same breath, they were lost in the admiration of utter fools.

[]

Since the 'thunderbolt' is the result of a secret weariness of what the catechism calls virtue, and of the boredom which comes from the monotony of perfection, I imagine it falls most often on those whom society labels good-for-nothing.

[]

Women love men for their defects.

[]

Woman... manifests a decided enthusiasm for mediocrity.

[]

Why have such scores of lovely, gifted girls
Married impossible men?
...
Has God's supply of tolerable husbands
Fallen, in fact, so low?
Or do I always over-value woman
At the expense of man? Do I? It might be so.

[]

The inexpressable contrast which exists between the nobility of my feelings and the meanness of my birth, my love for an adorable girl, as violent as it is insuperable, the fear of being the agent of her dishonor, the necessity of choosing between crime and death, all these have made me resolve to abandon life. I was born to be virtuous, I was about to be criminal; I preferred to die.

[]

...the role of a man pursuing a married woman, who had made it the purpose of his life to draw her into an adulterous association at all costs—...that role has something grand and beautiful about it...

[]

Passion-love carries us away in defiance of all our interests, gallant love manages always to respect them.

[]

Whoever is in love has, all the while, a conviction that his love is justified.

[]

My heart is full of zeal
to choose the grape,
even if the owner is Satan.

[]

Love knows no rule.

[]

Amor ordinem nescit.

[]

But love has never known a law
Beyond its own sweet will!

[]

Love to faults is always blind,
Always is to joy inclin'd,
Lawless, wing'd, & unconfin'd,
And breaks all chains from any mind.

[]

Let us be unashamed of soul,
As earth lies bare to heaven above!
How is it under our control
To love or not to love?

[]

My love I call her, and she loves me well:
But I love her as in the maelstrom's cup.
The whirled stone loves the leaf inseparable
That clings to it round all the circling swell,
And that the same last eddy swallows up.

[]

'Love without Hope'
Love without hope, as when the young bird-catcher
Swept off his tall hat to the Squire's own daughter,
So let the imprison'd larks escape and fly
Singing about her head as she rode by.

[]

Virtue, awake. Beauty but beauty is,
I may, I must, I can, I will, I do
Leave following that, which it is gain to miss.
Let her go. Soft but here she comes. Go to,
Unkind, I love you not: O me, that eye
Doth make my heart give to my tongue the lie.

[]

If you go down to Hammond
You'll never come back
In our opinion you're
On the wrong track...
If you go with that fellow
Forget about us
As far as we're concerned
That would be just
Throwing yourself away
Not even trying...

[]

"Why did she fall for the leader of the band?" is an eternal question.

[]

If thou wouldst marry wisely, marry thine equal.

[]

When one feels oneself smitten by love for a woman, one should say to oneself, 'Who are the people around her? What kind of life has she led?' All one's future happiness lies in the answer.

[]

I know what boys like, I know what guys want
I like to tease them
...Sucker!

[]

But she is one of those numerous women who can't stop flickering their eyelashes at anything in trousers, a compulsive flirt.

[]

...the beauty which... attracted him violently, and her consciousness of it and her desire that it should exert its influence on him...

[]

...it always gives ladies particular pleasure to seduce ascetics.

[]

She bewitched me
With such a sweet and genial charm,
I knew not when I wounded was,
And when I found it, hugged the harm.

[]

Causing trouble and disaster
is your habit.
You don't know what you want,
that is your loss.

[]

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true?

[]

Yet dearely I love you, and would be loved faine,
But ar betroth'd unto your enemie:
Divorce me, untie, or breake that knot againe,
Take me to you, imprison me, for I
Except you enthrall me, never shall be free,
Nor ever chast, except you ravish me.

[]

It was only now that Vronsky clearly realized for the first time that [Anna's] husband was a person who was connected with her. He knew she had a husband, but he did not believe in his existence...

[]

My sweetheart's the mule in the mines
I drive her without any lines
On the bumper I sit, and I chew and I spit
All over my sweetheart's behind.

[]

I've never fallen for
a little boy before...
Let go/ don't let go

[]

And after a while I began thinking about Mr. Osmand, and how he had died alone, and how he had once taught me out of Kennedy's Latin Primer to conjugate the verb of love, his shabby coat sleeve pressing gently against my arm.

[]

You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne... I have found it impossible to discharge my duties as king... without the help and support of the woman I love.

[]

...her son had refused a post of great importance to his career only because he wished to be able to see Anna...

[]

I'm the type who sees a burning building and is stupid enough to think the flames will stop once I walk in...

[]

In mannered love, and perhaps in the first five minutes of passionate love, a woman taking a lover will be more concerned with the way other women see him than the way she sees him herself.

[]

And what was worse, any girl could get him: she had only to be nice, to be a little tender, and a little curious...

[]

True it is that Daphnis is beautiful; but he is not the only one.

[]

Why should mine eyes see more in you
Than they can see in all the rest?

[]

She whom I love is hard to catch and conquer,
Hard, but O the glory of the winning were she won!

[]

The more vain-glorious they are, the more difficult is the capture of them.

[]

It is improper to love a woman whom one would be ashamed to desire in marriage.

[]

Love in the open hand, no thing but that,
Ungemmed, unhidden, wishing not to hurt,
As one should bring you cowslips in a hat
Swung from the hand, or apples in her skirt,
I bring you, calling out as children do:
"Look what I have!—And these are all for you."

[]

O Yoko
my love will turn you on.

[]

When you really love somebody you can't help feeling that you do them good by loving them.

[]

O love, of this wise love no word be said,
it will be solved in a diviner bed,
where the divine dance teaches self-love this,
that when we kiss it is a god we kiss.

[]

Ah, even once, to will another rather than oneself!

[]

...love flows in a warm affirmation of the beloved...an intense affirmation of another being, irrespective of his attitude towards us.

[]

...love itself is, by nature, a transitive act in which we exert ourselves on behalf of what we love.

[]

What measure Fate to him shall mete
Is not the noble Lover's care;
He's heart-sick with a longing sweet
To make her happy as she's fair.
...And, holding life as so much pelf
To buy her posies, learns this lore:
He does not rightly love himself
Who does not love another more.

[]

"Love seeketh not itself to please,
Nor for itself hath any care,
But for another gives its ease,
And builds a Heaven in Hell's despair."

[]

True love finds nothing good but what it knows will please its beloved.

[]

Transformation belongs to passionate pursuit, Apollo seizing Daphne...

[]

The more one loves the nearer he approaches God, for God is the spirit of infinite love.

[]

Base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them.

[]

... the feelings of courtoisie... allow even the most vilain to be gentil.

[]

The Eternal Feminine draws us upward.

[]

Contact with a high-minded woman is good for the life of any man.

[]

...being in love one simply has to tell the truth all the time...

[]

No more subtle master under heaven
Than is the maiden passion for a maid,
Not only to keep down the base in man
But teach high thought and amiable words
And courtliness, and the desire of fame
And love of truth, and all that makes a man.

[]

O burnish well the mirror of thy heart
And make it fair,
If thou desirest the image of thy Love
To shine reflected there.

[]

I was petty-minded, before I fell in love, precisely because I was occasionally tempted to consider myself great.

[]

If thou wouldst become a pilgrim on the path
Of love
The first condition is
That thou become as humble as dust
And ashes.

[]

When the soul understands and wakes to find
Thou hast within the heart of man Thy throne,
It sees how arrogant and blind
The self that but its mortal self hath known.

[]

Will naught my love avail?
Naught my desire?
Hold it as gold that is
Cleansed of impurities
Tried in the fire.

[]

Heaven, who knew best what man would move
And raise his thoughts above the brute,
Said, Let him be, and let him love!
That must alone his soul improve,
Howe'er philosophers dispute.

[]

True love makes the thought of death frequent, easy, without terrors; it becomes merely a standard of comparison, the price one would pay for many things.

[]

She in her left hand bears a leafy quince;
When with her right she crooks a finger, smiling.
How may the King hold back?
Royally then he barters life for love.

[]

But had I as many hearts as hairs,
As many loves as love has fears,
As many lives as years have hours:
They should be all and only yours.

[]

That living and dying in love are but one I have proved,
This only know I
That I live by the beauty of the Beloved
For whom I would die.

[]

...I would gladly plunge my hand into a hat to take out one of two tickets: 'Be loved by her' or 'Die at once'...

[]

Thou art my life, my love, my heart,
The very eyes of me:
And hast command of every part
To live and die for thee.

[]

Prosaic is a new word which I used to think ridiculous... but the contessina Leonore used the word prosaic, and I love to write it.

She felt herself clad in an impenetrable armor of falsehood. She felt that some invisible power was assisting and supporting her.

"Rebecca Thatcher (Tom glanced at her face—it was white with terror)... did you tear this book?" A thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to his feet and shouted, "I done it!"

Cherchez la femme!

[]

Sir, a man becomes a scoundrel without even meaning to. A pretty girl makes him lose his head. He fights for her, an accident happens, he's forced to live in the mountains, and from a smuggler he becomes a bandit before he knows it.

[]

Thus am I still provoked to every evil
By this good wicked spirit, sweet angel-devil.

[]

O Sorrow, in thy tangled paths I go,
The Kaaba's gateway I no longer know,
But bend my head wherever I see rise
The arch that curves o'er the Beloved's eyes.

[]

If I were fortunate enough to be allowed to do something for her, my first impulse would be to keep it a secret.

[]

I had a deep relieved happy consciousness of surrender to her will.

[]

...all I want is to be caught.

[]

If you are really devoted to one woman, then bow your head and yield your neck to the yoke.

I loved you, so
I drew these tides of men into my hands
and wrote my will across the sky in stars.

[]

Whatever you go on wanting will be the law of my being.

[]

For Love my breast doth fill
with such a fyre,
as what soe E're you will
is my desyer.

[]

Not a word can I bear
Spoken against you.

[]

...he eats and drinks very little, and if he is persuaded to sip the wine, he does so remembering his beloved. He thinks and acts only for her!

[]

I know thee what thou art,
I serve thee with my heart,
And fall before thee.

[]

No matter how much trouble it will give me,
whatever you say,
I will make it my duty
to give you what you want,
that we may increase your happiness,
And you may do what you like.

[]

I'll make thee glorious by my pen
And famous by my sword;
I'll serve thee in such noble ways
Was never heard before...

[]

Christ, I think he's even combed his hair!

[]

Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her;
If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,
Till she cry "Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,
I must have you!"

[]

...Love straightaway joined battle with him; and the thoughts Love sends into its own folk entered deeply into his heart, and from thenceforth he became a liegeman of love...

[]

...O pale flower,
grow, grow, and blossom out, and fill the air,
feed on his richness, grow, grow, blossom out,
and fill the air, and be enough for him.

[]

When you are in love, ...whether you are packed in a gallery listening to political speeches or riding at full gallop under enemy fire to relieve a garrison, you are always... finding new and apparently ideal ways of making her love you more.

[]

Who travels for love finds a thousand miles not longer than one.

[]

You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live...

[]

[Manon was] all that could attach me to life.

[]

Suppose she had telephoned, suppose she had come, when I was away?

[]

I had to stay in my rooms all the time in case Anne should decide to call.

[]

My love is my weight: because of it I move.

[]

...love, rather than being an elemental force, almost resembles a literary genre. ...love is not an instinct, but rather a creation...

[]

After the initial revelation,
love does demand a strategy:
that this is often
the beginning of the end
makes it no less imperative.

[]

That spring night I spent
Pillowed on your arm
Never really happened
Except in a dream.
Unfortunately I am
Talked about anyway.

[]

A burning soul does not imagine the ultimate favour, but the nearest one. For example, with a mistress who treats you severely you dream of holding her hand. Imagination does not naturally reach beyond the first step, and if it is forced it will very soon retreat for fear of profaning what it adores.

[]

Let Nature, if she please, disperse
My atoms over all the universe,
At the last they easily shall
Themselves know, and together call;
For thy love, like a mark, is stamped on all.

[]

...the most trivial remarks that he uttered now, even to people who had never heard of her, always somehow related to Odette...

[]

The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
Into his study of imagination,
And every lovely organ of her life,
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
More moving—delicate and full of life
Into the eye and prospect of his soul.

[]

Although my feet
Never cease running to you
On the path of dreams
Such nights of love are never worth
One glimpse of you in your reality.

[]

Good night! Good night! Ah, good the night
That wraps thee in its silver light,
Good night! No night is good for me
That does not hold a thought of thee. Good night!

[]

I arise from dreaming of thee
In the first sweet sleep of night,
When the winds are breathing low,
And the stars are shining bright.

[]

...the love which pervades the whole consciousness and fills it with pictures, some wildly happy, some hopeless, but all sublime...

[]

...as soon as she thought of her future with Vronsky, a dazzling perspective of happiness rose before her...

[]

Each step your imagination takes brings a new delight. Little wonder that this state of mind is enticing.

[]

What a man imagines is, apparently, more important to him than what his flesh experiences.

[]

When you are gone, I stand apart
And whisper to your image in my heart.

[]

She rose up in clouds of brilliant light in his head whenever he came across certain words in his reading. ("Mistress" was one, "beautiful" another...)

[]

I stared ahead of me through the warm silvery veil of my tears and saw Julian's face... hanging there in space, like a vision of the Savior...

[]

The lama's face, in meditation,
Won't seem to come to mind;
But the lover's face unbidden
Floats clearly through my mind.

[]

...I am the veil. The face underneath is hers.

[]

I felt that I was, at every instant, creating Julian and supporting her being with my own.

[]

...simply to think her, as a mystic thinks God with a thought which goes beyond thinking and becomes being.

[]

I drew her like a magnet and she had to come to me.

[]

An' she'd blush scarlet, right in prayer,
When her new meetin'-bonnet
Felt somehow thru' its crown a pair
O' blue eyes sot upon it.

[]

Blow there, sweet Zephyrus!
...and in soft language spoken low,
Thou gentle air, in secret make her know
How, like the phoenix, I do sacrifice
My heart to her, inflame'd by her eyes.

[]

I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.

[]

Before falling in love, I was defined.
Now I am undefined, weeds are growing between my ribs.

[]

...I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.

[]

If you dart forth disdainful rays,
To your own dye you turn my days.

[]

While her breath, speaking, kindled Nature's fire...

[]

...if you are truly in love and your lover says things which make you happy, you will lose the power of speech.

[]

Her use of my name nearly sent me spinning off into the water. I wanted suddenly to turn right round like someone in a dance. I think I gave a sort of gasp.

[]

As they walked down the street she turned her eyes towards me where I stood in fear and trembling, and with her ineffable courtesy, which is now rewarded in eternal life, she greeted me! and such was the virtue of her greeting that I seemed to experience the height of bliss.

[]

...she said to me
Jack, Jack, different than I had ever heard,
Because she wasn't calling me, I think,
Or telling me. She used my name to
Talk in another way I wanted to know.

[]

He looked at me when I passed
and my heart was in jubilee.

[]

...but for an instant, as she glanced at [Vronsky], her eyes lit up and though the fire was at once extinguished, that one instant made him happy.

[]

...her smile, which always transported Levin into an enchanted world where he felt softened, and overflowing with tenderness, as he remembered feeling on rare occasions in his early childhood.

[]

Le Bret: You are not quite so gloomy.
Cyrano: After all, she knows that I exist—no matter why!

[]

There was, it would seem, nothing extraordinary in what she had said, but what unutterable meaning there was in every sound of her words, in every movement of her lips, eyes, and hands as she said it!

[]

His actual presence disturbed the voluptuous pleasure of her reveries.

[]

There is a solitude in seeing you,
Followed by your presence when you are gone.
You are like heaven's veins of lightning.
I cannot see till afterward
How beautiful you are.
There is a blindness in seeing you,
Followed by the sight of you when you are gone.

[]

Mouse, why do you whisper love in your heart all day?
Why do you talk about her, incessantly,
All the time, any time
Except when she is present in the flesh?

[]

...did you... think of nothing but to read in her eyes what she thought of you at that moment, so that you had no thought of conveying your love for her through your own glances?

[]

...she searched his face for signs of the impression she was making on him.

[]

She was filled with indignation when she saw that big red hand, its fingers as soft as slugs, touching those pages that had once made her heart pound with emotion.

[]

I won't wash it—
The dress he gave me;
Love's past
would fade.

[]

One evening at a party he kissed her hand; and you will observe that since then she has been careful, even at the risk of appearing odd, to allow no one else to kiss her hand.

[]

I had put Julian's chair well out of the way.

[]

...she lingers
There, like sunshine over the ground...

[]

I have kept your churi under my pillow so that I have your flavour all the time with me.

[]

...I was sitting on the floor hugging the chair which she had sat in.

[]

Thou more than most sweet glove,
Unto my more sweet love,
Suffer me to store with kisses
This empty lodging that now misses
The pure rosy hand that ware thee...

[]

Where the Chikuma flows through Shinama,
If but on the pebbles you tread,
I will gather them up, like precious gems
From the river bed.

[]

As if two wax candles were so close together that the light were all one.

[]

...an untiring instinct for migration, a wild urge to depart from oneself to the other. ...this constant state of migration is what it is to be in love.

[]

...a feeling of being absorbed by him to the core of our being, as if he had torn us from our own vital depths and we were living trees transplanted, our vital roots within him.

[]

...lots and lots of things weren't real to me at all until I'd told you about them.

[]

I was also aware of myself filling up with all kinds of things I wanted to tell her.

[]

...genuine sexual love, that is, ardor for another being, his body and soul in indissoluble union, is in itself primarily a gigantic force entrusted with improving the species.

[]

The most genuine lovers will truthfully admit that they did not feel—at least, initially—a desire for physical union.

[]

One day I will kiss you so
that the flowers tremble.

[]

This cup has touched
Zenophila's teasing mouth, sweet snare of love.
Oh happiness, if she
Would press her lips to my lips, and in one
Deep draught drink down my soul!

[]

Appetite [as opposed to love] ...does not result in surrender of oneself, but, on the contrary, in the capture of the object.

[]

She seems to be your property, because you alone can make her happy.

[]

I wish I was an apple
A-hangin on a tree
And every time my true love passed
She'd take a bite of me!

[]

A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice

[]

Yourself—your soul—in pity give me all,
Withhold no atom's atom or I die...

[]

When, far down the street, he saw a white satin hat that looked like the one Mme ... wore, his heart missed a beat, and he had to lean against the wall for support.

[]

...my heart suddenly nearly fell out of me because the telephone rang and I thought it might be her. [Then] the front doorbell rang. My heart performed the same swoop into emptiness.

[]

And oh, the towering feel-ing!
Just to know, somehow you are near!
The o-verpowering feel-ing
That any moment, you may suddenly, appear!

[]

...he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility of her sudden apparition...

[]

Forget the rest: my heart is true
And in its waking thought of you
Gives the same wild and sudden leap
That jerks it from the brink of sleep.

[]

If you come to me
Moonbeams fill my room.

[]

A thrilling current of sheer joy came from the woman beside me and warmed my whole body and made it tingle with well-being.

[]

He knew she was there by the joy and terror that gripped his heart.

[]

And if perchance by me there pass
She unto whom I sue for grace,
The cold blood forsaketh my face...

[]

Ah, my pretty jewel
I love you as a pig loves the mud.

[]

If I could share this old moondance with you, my love.

[]

I want to be the Moon
And shine
On the bed
Where he sleeps.

[]

I wish I were close
To you as the wet skirt of
A salt girl to her body.
I think of you always.

[]

Just like an angel,
beautiful without blemish,
how can I stay away from you?

[]

...even the thought of leaving Florence [Italy] makes him feel he is dying.

[]

Merely to run toward you is cool water
For a man who is thirsty.

[]

I do not feel ashamed
to follow you wherever you are.

[]

Ideally, there should be no kindness in the role of either the man or the woman. Self-seeking, in one of the paradoxes with which love abounds, they find each other.

[]

Love seeketh only self to please,
To bind another to Its delight,
Joys in another's loss of ease,
And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite.

[]

The plain English of the politest address of a gentleman to a lady, is, I am now, dear madam, the humblest of your servants: Be so good as to allow me to be your Lord and Master.

[]

Self-love, my love, no farther goes than this,
that when we kiss, it is ourselves we kiss.

[]

Love is nothing save an insatiate thirst to enjoy a greedily desired object.

[]

...not to flatter ourselves, ours is but a refined degree of madness. What can it be else to be lost to all things in the world but that single object that takes up one's fancy, to lose all the quiet and repose of one's life in hunting after it, when there is so little likelihood of ever gaining it...?

[]

But even if a man or a woman were so fine and so wise that their claim to be such could be denied by no one, it would still be a form of madness to direct upon him or upon her the kind of exclusive worshipping attention in which being in love consists.

[]

Crazy you call me
Sure I'm crazy
Crazy in love with you.

[]

Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, desires a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too.

[]

The ecstatic is more or less a madman. He lacks moderation and mental clarity.

[]

Were it not reasonably common, men could surely be locked up for such a change of consciousness.

[]

I was dreadfully in love with the sort of black certain metaphysical love that cuts deeper than anything, and thus seems its own absolute justification.

[]

What is done from love is always beyond good and evil.

[]

Mine Eyes the Glasse, the Needle is my Soule,
Love is the Loadstone, My beloved the Pole.

[]

...all the happiness of his life, the sole meaning of his life, he now found in seeing and hearing her.

[]

Fog clings
To the high mountain
My eye clings
to him.

[]

To see you, little one,
that is my need,
my heart presses inside me,
I cannot wait.

[]

Ne joy of aught that under heaven doth hove,
Can comfort me, but her own joyous sight.

[]

For heaven itself I should not care
Unless I saw Clorinda there.

[]

Thou sweet kindler of desires.

[]

...to the Don Juans I will say this, that a man in fear and trembling is never bored. The pleasures of love are always in proportion to the fear.

[]

When I see a man being sad I believe he is falling in love.

[]

The soul of a man in love smells of the closed-up room of a sick man—its confined atmosphere is filled with stale breath.

[]

...my natural spirit began to be impeded in its functioning, for my soul was wholly given to thoughts of this most gracious person. In a short time I grew so frail and weak that many of my friends felt concern at my appearance.

[]

He who is not impatient is not in love.

[]

...the tension of waiting... so ravished and stripped bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea, not one memory in his mind behind which his troubled spirit might take shelter and repose...

[]

When you are to meet your beloved in the evening, the anticipation of such immense happiness makes the intervening minutes quite unbearable.

[]

The green sickness of love.

[]

Love is always pictured as naked.

[]

Symptoms of true love
Are leanness, jealousy,
Laggard dawns;
Are omens and nightmares—
Listening for a knock,
Waiting for a sign.

[]

Why does love have to make you feel weak?

[]

The night is unbearable,
Oh, let me go to you
For there is no one,
There is nothing
To comfort me but you.

[]

Many a time she made me die...

[]

Love in my bosom like a bee
Doth suck his sweet...

[]

Now Love that dissolves the limbs shakes me,
Sweetly bitter unvanquishable creeping thing.

[]

Once I had friends, now none are left to me;
I see none else but you, because my heart Has wholly fled to you,
And thus I walk the ways of Earth apart.

[]

Because your voice was at my side
I gave him pain.
Because within my hand I held
Your hand again.

There is no word nor any sign
Can make amend—
He is a stranger to me now
Who was a friend.

[]

My dear Nora, It has just struck me. I came in at half past eleven. Since then I have been sitting in an easy chair like a fool. I could do nothing. I hear nothing but your voice. I am like a fool hearing you call me 'Dear.' I offended two men today by leaving them coolly. I wanted to hear your voice, not theirs.

[]

My thought is like the stream; and flows and follows you on forever.

[]

My thoughts seek you as waves that seek the shore,
And when I think of you, I am at rest.

[]

...the thought of his absent mistress was incessantly, indissolubly blended with all the simple actions of Swann's daily life—when he took his meals, opened his letters, went for a walk or to bed—by the very sadness he felt at having to perform those actions without her; like those initials of Philibert the Fair which, in the church of Brou, because of her grief and longing for him, Margaret of Austria intertwined everywhere with her own.

[]

She was [for him] the amorous heroine of all novels and plays, the vague 'she' of all poetry.

[]

In all the novels I read, his idea accompanied me & I did little else from morning to night but read novels.

[]

And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,
Love itself shall slumber on.

[]

I love her more than skies bright with the wind and sun
and all my thoughts arise
to travel, one by one,
into her lips and eyes.

[]

The dawning of morn, the daylight's sinking,
The night's long hours still find me thinking
Of thee, thee, only thee.

[]

Throughout all these absurdities... I had not for a second stopped thinking about Kitty. The thought of her now filled out about me like a great vibrating sphere.

[]

At about half past three I went to bed and to sleep, and the thought of Kitty spread a tent of quietness above my dreaming head.

[]

The lover's every action ends with the thought of the beloved... A person in love is unremittingly and uninterruptedly occupied with the image of the beloved.

[]

A man does not have the stamina
to put love aside.

[]

And all is dross that is not Helena.

[]

"Ambition? Society? The Court?" There was nothing that interested him there. They had all had a meaning for him once, but now he no longer cared for any of it.

[]

With single Love Ile feed my breast
That so on double it may feast
When you love mee mee best.

[]

I wanna be loved by you
Just you and nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you alone

[]

Now Since an Object I have gain'd
Whereon to sett & fix my heart
My wandringe thoughts are all restrain'd
I feele no Rack of doubtfull Smart
I would not for a Kingdome be
Redeem'd from this Captivitye Of loveing thee

[]

...nothing in this wide universe I call,
Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.

[]

It was as if there was no one in the universe except me and Kitty.

[]

When one has just seen the woman one loves, the sight of every other woman damages the vision and physically hurts the eyes...

[]

He will prefer to dream of the slenderest chance of pleasing her, rather than to receive all the favours of any femme vulgaire.

[]

The man whose heart has leapt at the glimpse of his beloved's white satin hat in the distance is surprised at his own indifference to the greatest society beauty...

[]

There was only one being in the world who was able to concentrate for him the whole world and the meaning of life.

[]

A sign of love has just struck me; it is when all the pleasures and all the pains attributable to all the other passions and all the other needs of a man cease abruptly to affect him.

[]

...falling in love burns away conflicting emotions...

[]

"Falling in love" is a phenomenon of attention.

[]

And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,
Your own glass shows you when you look at it.

[]

All measure, and all language, I should pass,
Should I tell what a miracle she was.

[]

...I sometimes hold my tongue,
Because I would not dull you with my song.

[]

Every child from the bazaar was singing his verses; every passer-by was humming one of his love-songs, bringing Layla a message from her beloved, whether they knew it or not.

[]

Of these songs you yourself well know how some have become widely known and have been sung in many lands...

[]

...in black ink my love may still shine bright.

[]

No man ever forgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain, which created all things new; which was the dawn in him of music, poetry, and art.

[]

I know love
not from books,
nor have I got it from hearsay,
from others who have experienced it.
Love has been granted
in its wonderful sweetness.

[]

For a great painter or a great poet love is divine because it multiplies a hundredfold the scope and the pleasures of the art which gives his soul its daily bread.

[]

The nightingale
cannot help singing,
for she sparkles with love in her whole being...

[]

Love was glowing in him. When it burst into flames it also took hold of his tongue...

[]

She had filled me with a previously unimaginable power which I knew that I would and could use in my art.

[]

At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet.

[]

"We ask you to tell us in what this joy of yours resides!" And I, in reply to her, said this: "In words which praise my lady."

[]

Tune on my pipe the praises of my Love,
And, midst thy oaten harmony, recount
How fair she is that makes thy music mount
And every string of thy heart's harp to move.

[]

An air of coolness plays upon his face,
And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.
And then he thinks he knows,
The hills where his life rose,
And the sea where it goes.

[]

The woman in love has the conviction, for which we all long, that her life is unified, that it has direction and meaning, that its direction is toward, and its meaning suffused with, the truth, that in love she transcends time and makes herself one with forces which are eternal.

[]

The sense of being absolutely in the right and longed-for place.

[]

My salvation lay in her because I saw that she was filled with the joy of living...

[]

[He] persisted in connecting all his dreams of artistical success with Annie's image...

[]

When a'body's thochts is set on his ain salvation,
Mine's set on you.

[]

...my love, the medicine of my heart...

[]

Your hand was honey-comb to heal,
Your voice a web to bind.
You were a Mending flower to me
To cure my heart and mind.

[]

It was like being seen by God. She bathed my hurt soul in a reviving dew.

[]

I am come to her wonder
Like a boy finding a star in a haymow
And there is nothing cruel or mad or evil
Anywhere.

[]

Let Phyllis be mine, and but ever be kind,
I could to a desert with her be confined,
And envy no monarch his reign.

[]

My only need—you ask me, and I tell you—
Is that henceforth forever you exist.

[]

I am simply happy that you exist... proud to live with you in the same city, in the same century...

[]

Now your source of joy has been revealed.

[]

To see her among others, straying like a divine form among mortals, is to become faint with secret knowledge.

[]

A person
in love
lives not off himself
but off the other,
as a child,
before birth,
lives bodily off its mother...

[]

There is no doubt that love is continually being fed; it derives nourishment from the beloved's charms, which it beholds either in reality or in imagination.

[]

So true a fool is love that in your will,
Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.

[]

With all thy faults, I love thee still.

[]

It is enough if there is some perfection in him...

[]

The projection of imaginary qualities upon a real object is a constant phenomenon. In man, to see things—moreover, to appreciate them!—always means to complete them.

[]

La Ghita is certainly no more than a pretext for all the raptures of this poor German...

[]

Each step your imagination takes brings a new delight. Little wonder that this state of mind is enticing.

[]

Love is the only passion which rewards itself in a coin of its own manufacture.

[]

Once you begin to examine your lover, it is no longer a case of passionate but of mannered love.

[]

Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind.

[]

...beauty can only suggest probabilities about a woman and about her self-possession (sang-froid). But the eyes of your pockmarked mistress are a wonderful reality which makes nonsense of all possible probabilities.

[]

"...from the first moment I became your servant no thought has entered my heart but that you are the best that ever was born, and the truest in words and seeming."

[]

...for Levin all the girls in the world were divided into two classes: one class included all the girls in the world except her and all of them had all the human weaknesses, and all of them were very ordinary; the other class contained Kitty alone, a girl who had no weaknesses of any kind and who was above the rest of humanity.

[]

Before the nature of an object can produce its proper sensation in them, they have blindly invested it from afar with imaginary charm which they conjure up inexhaustibly within themselves.

[]

O brave new world,
That has such people in't!

[]

Only once in our lives do we love with our whole heart[s] a being whom we cannot do without: a gaping abyss separates that being from the rest of mankind.

[]

...yet you will saye, theres nought can be
whyte, softe or sweet that is not she.

[]

If ever any beauty I did see,
Which I desir'd, and got, 'twas but a dreame of thee.

O Queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.

[]

Love generates, or rather reveals, something which may be called absolute charm.

[]

...there was a truth somewhere which denied Kitty, only I loved Kitty more than that truth...

[]

...it was not unlike me to imbue other people, on occasion, with qualities that I desperately wanted them to have.

[]

But love is blind and lovers cannot see
The pretty follies that themselves commit.

[]

Love is the state in which man sees things most decidedly as they are not.

[]

Our friend with the great soul...

[]

Paradise is your abode,
on earth you are suffering.

[]

Dearest Mary pure and holey meek and loly lovely Rose of Sharon...

[]

I cannot rise to follow her,
Here in the dust is my abode,
For I am but her foot-print left
Lying forgotten in the road.

[]

No man could think base thoughts who looked on her...

[]

Serene and serious, still and quaint,
She's partly woman, partly saint,
This Presbyterian beauty.

[]

I'm glad that it was not my chance to live
Till as that heavenly creature first was born,
Who as an angel doth the earth adorn
And buried virtue in the tomb revive:
For vice overflows the world with such a flood,
That in it all, save she, there is no good.

[]

If in your face, divine effects I view,
Ah, who can blame me, if I worship you?

[]

Yet enlisting hope doth woe me
To think one woman may be true
And in your Angells shape comes to me
Oh God what power then rests in you.

[]

Her breath is life, her eyes are day,
And all mankind her creatures are.

[]

The moon wooed the lotus in the night
The lotus was wooed by the moon
And my sweetheart is their child
The blossom opened in the night
And she came forth
The petals moved and she was born.

[]

Her lips' remark was: "Oh, you kid!"
Her soul spoke thus (I know it did):
"O king of realms of endless joy,
My own, my golden grocer's boy."

[]

If all, so much as I, your music love
The whole world would at your devotion move...

[]

When I look at you with my eyes,
be the coolness of my eye.

[]

He makes my eyes cool with his smile.

[]

...perfect music has the same effect on the heart as the presence of the beloved.

[]

For your sweet beauty, daintily transfused
With due proportion throughout every part,
What is it but a dance where Love hath used
His finer cunning and more curious art;
Where all the elements themselves impart,
And turn, and wind, and mingle with such measure,
That th'eye that sees it, surfeits with the pleasure?

[]

When he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.

[]

...what I feel,
Here in this room, desiring you,
Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk
is music.

[]

As soft as down: and were she down
Jove might come down and kiss
A love so fresh, so sweet, so white,
So smooth, so soft, as this.

[]

More than most fair, full of that heavenly fire
Kindled above to show the Maker's glory
Beauty's first born, in whom all powers conspire
to write the Graces' life, and Muses' story!

[]

A thousand Cupids fly
About her gentle eye.
From which each throws a dart
that kindleth soft sweet fire
Within my sighing heart
Possessed by desire...

[]

When she a little smiles, her aspect then
No tongue can tell, no memory can hold,
So rare and strange a miracle is she.

[]

Beautie's the soule of humane Excellence,
the Eyes blest object, rapture of the sence,
Vertue's most glorious Garment, lov's rich shryne,
Earths onely Phoenix, natures worke divine,
the Common Idoll of All harts, o then,
beauty that masters gods must Conquer Men.

[]

So light is my mistress, so graceful is she,
I tremble lest the breath of the evening
woo her from me...

[]

...the perfume I adore
That clings to thee

[]

She lilts a low soft language, and I hear
Down long sea-chambers of the inner ear.

[]

Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,
'Tis a woman's whole existence.

[]

A man completes a woman in a way, alas for him—and for her—in which she cannot complete him. He arises from her arms, his hunger for joint-stock companies, turbo jets, and plantations on the moon unappeased. While she has him, her sun. What does the moon and outer space mean to her?

[]

Love, an episode in the life of man, is the entire story of the life of woman.

[]

When the state of "being in love"... is sought for itself, or prolonged for itself, or valued for itself, there is an autoeroticism of the emotions more arid and damaging than any physical autoeroticism.

[]

The woman may not yet love... the man or boy who has elicited these feelings; but she does love the person she has become: a woman purified by love's focusing... No woman, if given a choice of inscriptions for her tombstone, would choose "Mary Jones, a greatly loved woman" rather than "Mary Jones, a greatly loving woman."

[]

In Geneva and France, ...girls fall in love at sixteen in order to make a novel out of life, and at each step, almost at each tear, they ask themselves: 'Am I not just like Julie d'Etanges?'

[]

...when a man really loves he rejoices or trembles no matter what he thinks about... Now rejoicing and trembling are interesting activities beside which all others pale. ...Nothing is so interesting as passion; everything about it is unexpected, and its agent is also its victim.

[]

It should be remembered that a person under the stress of strong emotions seldom has time to notice the emotions of whoever is causing them.

[]

In her first passion woman loves her lover,
In all the others all she loves is love.

[]

The love of the wife for the husband is not for the sake of the husband but for the sake of the self; the love of the husband for the wife is not for the sake of the wife but for the sake of the self.

[]

Oh don't be so gay and flippant, you look so horribly pleased with yourself, what's the matter?

[]

Love cannot be anything but egotistical.

[]

...the impression she had made on him filled him with happiness and pride.

[]

...my marvelous achievement of absolute love.

[]

The pleasure of love lies in loving; we are happier in the passion we feel than in that we inspire.

[]

Terrible and sublime thought, that every moment is supreme for some man and woman, every hour the apotheosis of some passion!

[]

There are no age limits for love. 

[]

...it is one of the peculiarities, perhaps one of the blessings, of this planet that anyone can experience this transformation of the world. Also, anyone can be its object.

[]

...love is an infrequent occurrence, a sentiment which only certain souls can hope to experience: in fact, a specific talent which some individuals possess... Almost all men and women live submerged in the sphere of their own interests (some without doubt, beautiful and respectable), and are incapable of feeling the migratory urge toward what is outside themselves.

[]

Let us cease believing that the measure of a man's love lies in how stupid he has become or is willing to be.

[]

The mistress of a house knows that her maid has fallen in love when she begins to notice that the maid is distracted.

[]

Are the stars out tonight?

[]

I had just uttered Julian's name aloud.

[]

And what was our disease we could not tell.

[]

Have you got softening of the brain?

[]

...I noticed he often spoke without knowing what he was saying or to whom he was saying it.

[]

Sleep with her one night and you're mixed up
seven days after.

[]

She smiled contemptuously and took up her book again, but this time she could not understand a word of what she was reading.... The tension... reached such a point that she was afraid every minute that something would snap within her under the intolerable strain.

[]

O, love, love, love!
Love is like a dizziness;
It winna let a poor body
Gang about his business!

[]

O my stars how you undo me!
O my stars...

[]

A sensitive man, once his heart is stirred, loses all memory of habit as a guide to action; how can he keep on the track when he has lost the scent?

[]

I watch the red buds turn to green leaves.
My thoughts are many and tumultuous,
As troubled as the tossing branches,
All for thinking of you.

[]

His senses are confused, because for him this jewel is the eye of the world.

[]

Beauty the god of wisdome can confound,
not one of all the Gods, hath scapt that wound.

[]

Strange is the journey that my soul by wanton Love was led,
Two steps were straight and clear, and four forgotten
were instead.

[]

...then my spirits were so routed by the power which Love acquired on finding himself so close to this most gracious being that none survived except the spirits of vision... A number of the women present, observing my transformation, began to be astonished and, talking about it, they mocked at me in company with the most gracious one herself.

[]

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die...
(And I love her)

[]

If I love thee not, chaos is come again.

[]

Not one word, not one gesture of yours will I ever forget, nor can I ever forget.

[]

Nothing can ever extinguish the love for you in my heart. It is a riddle without a solution, a code which none can decipher...

[]

I love thee, I love but thee,
With a love that cannot die
Till the sun grows cold,
And the stars are old,
And the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold!

[]

My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.

[]

On thee, dainty dear life, my love is fixed.

[]

The foreverness of real love is one of the reasons why even unrequited love is a source of joy.

[]

There's a hammer in my heart
Pounding out your name...!

[]

...my heart was beating Kitty tomorrow, Kitty tomorrow.

[]

[He went to a certain restaurant] only for one of those reasons, at once mystical and absurd, which people call 'romantic'; because this restaurant bore the same name as the street in which Odette lived: La Pe'rouse.

[]

Everything in the world was Julian.

[]

O my dove, thou art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs...

[]

Why did the fragrance of the flowers outflow
If not to breathe with benediction sweet
Across her path? Why did the soft wind blow
If not to kiss the ground before her feet?

[]

A lover sees the woman he loves in every skyline, and as he travels a hundred leagues to catch a momentary glimpse of her each tree, each rock speaks to him in a different way and teaches him something new about her.

[]

Not from the whole wide world I chose thee—
Sweetheart, light of the land and the sea!
The wide, wide world could not inclose thee,
For thou art the whole wide world to me.

[]

The sight of everything that is extremely beautiful, in Nature and in the arts, calls up the image of your beloved like a flash of lightning.

[]

If I look on a wildflower I see her face there...

[]

Tree you are,
Moss you are,
You are violets with wind above them.

[]

My beloved
Must be coming this evening.
For the behavior
Of the spiders on the bamboo grass
Is striking this evening.

[]

...where her heart beats, there is my home.

[]

Love is space and time made directly perceptible to the heart.

[]

...her presence gave the house what none of the other houses that he visited seemed to possess: a sort of nervous system, a sensory network which ramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his heart.

[]

...the supreme sign of true love: being close to what is loved, in a more profound contact and proximity than that of space.

[]

We are with [our friend] in a symbolic union—our soul seems to expand miraculously, to clear the distance, and no matter where he is, we feel that we are in essential communion with him.

[]

Love is where the glory falls
Of Thy face—on convent walls
Or on the tavern floors, the same
Unextinguishable flame.

[]

I have often walked
Down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I
Several storeys high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live...

[]

For love, all love of other sights controls,
And makes one little room, an everywhere.

[]

A common though not invariable early phase of this madness... is a false loss of self, which can be so extreme that all fear of pain, all sense of time (time is anxiety, is fear) is utterly blotted out.

[]

Time had already become eternity. There was a huge warm globe of conscious being within which I moved with extreme slowness...

[]

I had to load somebody with presents.

[]

I glowed with a flame of charity which moved me to forgive all who had ever injured me...

[]

There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear.

[]

I was purged of resentment and of hate, purged of all the mean anxious fears that compose the vile ego.

[]

And when love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.

[]

...I gazed out with wide peaceful eyes at a world devoid of evil.

[]

...love makes one calmer about many things...

[]

I felt as if I should never need to eat again, but could live indefinitely simply by breathing.

[]

Love is enough: though the World be a-waning...

[]

Love is the perfect sum
Of all delight.

[]

Dear joy, how I do love thee!

[]

When I was small I was gay, but it has taken me nearly all the years in between to recover it, because no one allowed me to believe it until you gave it back to me.

[]

There is a sense of one's own face as stretched, as thinned, which goes with extreme joy. I felt as if my face were simply a stretched skin, the features vanished, the pure radiance blazing through.

[]

All mankind love a lover.

[]

Brad, what is it, you look extraordinary, something's happened to you, you're beautiful, you look like a saint or something, you look like some goddamn picture, you look all young again—

[]

It was not the words, nor the melody,
Not the beat, nor the pace;
It was that slow suspension of our breathing
As we watched your face,
And the grace-notes, unrecordable on the clef,
Sung only by a spirit in grace.

[]

Love teaches even asses to dance.

[]

...passion gives a strength above nature, we see it in mad people...

[]

I—I am going to be a storm—a flame—
I need to fight whole armies all alone;
I have ten hearts; I have a hundred arms; I feel
Too strong to war with mortals—BRING ME GIANTS!

[]

He moved without any effort of his muscles and felt that he could do anything. He was sure that, if necessary, he could fly upward or lift the corner of a house.

[]

I could have danced all night
I could have danced all night
And still have begged for more...

[]

There seemed to be no gravity in the park that morning.

[]

If I were a bell
I'd go ding dong ding dong ding!

[]

The heart that loves is always young.

[]

Love in its essence is spiritual fire.

[]

The woman in love... renews herself by becoming, once again, as the young are, a person who sees in another rare virtues and graces.

[]

I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

[]

O happy race of men, if love, which rules Heaven, rule your minds!

[]

In love, realities obligingly rearrange themselves to conform with desire.

[]

Yea, to such freshness, fairness, fulness, fineness, freeness,
Love lures life on.

[]

If I have freedom in my love,
And in my soul am free;
Angels alone that soar above
Enjoy such liberty.

[]

Passionate love spreads all Nature in her sublimity before a man's eyes, like something invented only yesterday. He is surprised never to have noticed the strange sights he now perceives.

[]

Love a` la Werther opens the mind to all the arts, to all sweet and romantic impressions, moonlight, the beauty of the woods and of painting, in a word, to the feeling and enjoyment of the beautiful, in whatever form it presents itself, even the humblest. It shows the way to happiness even without riches.

[]

...his first impulse was to thank Heaven for rendering him again the being of thought, imagination, and keenest sensibility that he had long ceased to be.

[]

And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming, O then I was happy,
O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food nourish'd me more, and the beautiful day pass'd well.

[]

Music I heard with you was more than music,
And bread I broke with you was more than bread.

[]

Tonight, the world looks like a different place...

[]

And there I asked...
What change you'd wrought in graveyard, rock and sea,
This new wild paradise to wake for me...

[]

And every sound that meets the ear is Love.

[]

This shifting House of Mirrors
where we dwell
Under Thy charm a fairy palace seems...

[]

I tell thee Love is Nature's second sun,
Causing a spring of virtues where he shines.

[]

What life is there, what delight, without golden Aphrodite?

[]

Love, the bright atmosphere, the vital air,
Of youth; without it life and death are one.

[]

Everything became bright in her presence.

[]

...give light sweet light to me, & lett me shyne by thee...

[]

I am all on fire with new-wakened love...

[]

Last night, when some one spoke his name,
From my swift blood that went and came
A thousand little shafts of flame
Were shiver'd in my narrow frame.

[]

'Ecstasy of Chaos'
When the immense drugged universe explodes
In a cascade of unendurable colour
And leaves us gasping naked,
This is no more than ecstasy of chaos:
Hold fast, with both hands, to the royal love
Which alone, as we know certainly, restores
Fragmentation into true being.

[]

It was as if stars were exploding in front of my eyes so that I literally could not see.

[]

You came upon me like a landslide
Once in a while I can take it like that
And I like it...

[]

Don't push your foot on the heartbrake!

[]

...the irreproachable secret
Of love, which is: never to turn back.

[]

...one must be faithful to one's destiny.

[]

You're the one that I want! (Oooh, hooo hooo...!)

[]

Love is the proudest of despots: it is either everything or nothing.

[]

Love, for the deadly sins are seven,
Only through love will you enter heaven.

[]

Give all to love;
Obey thy heart;
[...]
Nothing refuse.
'Tis a brave master;
Let it have scope:
Follow it utterly...

[]

When love walks in the room
Everybody stand up!
Oooooh, it's good! good! good!
Say Iloveyou!Iloveyou!Iloveyou!Iloveyou!Iloveyou!!!

[]

...overwhelmed and dead, almost
I stumbled on your secret door
Which saves the live man from the ghost.

[]

All I remember is I saw you look at me
And I couldn't breathe and I hurt so bad I couldn't see.

[]

He went down, trying not to look long at her, as though she were the sun, but he saw her, as one sees the sun, without looking.

[]

I dare not gaze upon her face.

[]

The only victory over love is flight.

[]

...we are as deeply afraid to live and to love as we are to die.

[]

The weak individual... fears the unexpected, which life may hold enveloped in the folds of her billowing skirt...

[]

I dare not ope the door.
To hear the sweet birds sing
Oft proves a dangerous thing.

[]

...whoever falls in love does so because he wants to fall in love.

[]

Love does not ask
when it seizes a man.

[]

...the fundamental surrender is not carried out on the plane of will, but occurs more deeply within the person.

[]

Love is like a fever which comes and goes quite independently of the will.

[]

It is not mere feeling, but a sort of force outside me which has taken possession of me.

[]

How strange the turns of Love's unending game,
For neither Lover nor Beloved lit
The ever-burning flame:
Whence was the spirit that enkindled it?

[]

I felt as if my stomach had ben shot away, leaving a gaping hole.

[]

The moment I saw her I say in all truth that the vital spirit, which dwells in the inmost depths of the heart, began to tremble so violently that I felt the vibration alarmingly in all my pulses, even the weakest of them.

[]

Falling in love is, in fact, an enchantment; Tristan's magic potion has always symbolized with suggestive plasticity the psychological process of love.

[]

Incipit vita nova: here begins a new life.

[]

Behold a god more powerful than I, who comes to rule over me.

[]

Whoever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?

[]

I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met...

[]

I ne'er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete...

[]

How has my bird-like soul been stricken low,
Pierced to the very heart!
My love has used instead of bolt and bow
A deadlier dart.

[]

Love wakes men, once a lifetime each;
They lift their heavy lids, and look...

[]

It needs only a very small quantity of hope to give birth to love.

[]

It's odd to think we might have been
Sun, moon and stars unto each other—
Only, I turned down one little street
And you went up another.

[]

...the mind of the lover abhors accident... surely it was lovers who discovered astrology... My love for Julian must have been figured before the world began... When God said, "Let there be light," this love was made.

[]

Yet when I heard your name that first far time
It seemed like other names to me, and I
Was all unconscious, as a dreaming river
That nears at last its long predestined sea...

[]

There is a lady sweet and kind,
Was never face so pleased my mind;
I did but see her passing by,
And yet I love her till I die.

[]

That beautiful pale face is my fate.

[]

What was it that controlled me?
What kept my love-life lean?
My intuition told me
You'd come on the scene.

[]

Crushes. I love crushes. There's always somebody new. You see someone handsome on the bus, fantasize, fall in love, then the bus stops and you get off. It lasts five minutes, then it's over—the perfect relationship. I don't have time for anything else.

[]

'Love at first sight,' some say, misnaming
Discovery of twinned helplessness
Against the huge tug of procreation.
But friendship at first sight? This also
Catches fiercely at the surprised heart
So that the cheek blanches and then blushes.

[]

The heart has its reasons which the reason does not know.

[]

The woman who resembles us is antipathic: what we seek in the other sex is the opposite of ourselves.

[]

Love is but the discovery of ourselves in others, and the delight in the recognition.

[]

Madam, I have been looking for a person who disliked gravy all my life; let us swear eternal friendship.

[]

O cricket is to cricket dear,
and ant for ant doth long.

At Sunday dinner, with your defenses down
I fell in love...

To let the value of your gifts decrease will seem to express a decline in interest.

It was the first time he had ever bought flowers for a woman, when he smelled them his chest swelled with pride, as though this tribute intended for someone else had turned back upon himself.

[]

Buffalo gal, won't you come out tonight
and dance by the light of the moon?

Mm Mm Mm Would you like to take a walk?
Mm Mm Mm Do you think it's gonna rain?
Mm Mm Mm How about a sasparilla?
Gee the moon is yeller
Sump'n good'll come from that!

Johnny had said when I first met him how he had always had, like, these problems with women, and at the time I dug him so much for saying that because I thought: aw, hey, this guy's just like me. Which is to say he lacked confidence in himself as a person. Or, to put it another way, he did not know who he really was as a man, just like I did not know who I really was as a woman. And so we could start from scratch, the two of us, and find out together.

Del Rosso insists upon a woman who... gives him the opportunity and incentive to display his particular brand of charm.

[]

We are carefully watching each other,
We are prowling through casual speech,
We are drifting towards reefs through the smother
Of each one's awareness of each.
We are jockeying now for position,
We are dropping the duellist's glove,
We are tempting the cruel perdition
Of something called love.

[]

Sometimes I think I must send out vibrations that say, 'calling all rats, calling all rats'!

[]

...some kindly sentiment... would flash from her eyes like a ray of gold.

[]

Jeepers Creepers! Where'd you get those peepers?
Jeepers Creepers! Where'd you get those eyes?

[]

I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
Them there eyes!

[]

Glances are the big guns of the virtuous coquette; everything can be conveyed in a look, and yet that look can always be denied, because it cannot be quoted word for word.

[]

Mystical grammar of amorous glances...

[]

I, with whose eyes her eyes committed theft.

[]

The very sensitive need a woman to be easy of access if crystallization is to be encouraged.

[]

...so beautiful and proud that all men fear her...

[]

...beauty is so full of pride.

[]

Tell me, is there any part of me
That is not loveable?

[]

...here was the sort of... girl who could bestow indescribable benefits on any young man she liked—and on his confidence.

[]

If the heart of a man is deprest with cares,
The mist is dispell'd when a woman appears;
Like the notes of a fiddle she sweetly, sweetly
Raises the spirits, and charms our ears.

[]

Beauty is only the promise of happiness.

[]

The saying that beauty is but skin deep is but a skin deep saying.

The normal man 'likes' almost every woman he encounters.

Flirting is to a woman what experimentation is to electricity.

If, in the presence of women with feminine pride, you accept insults gracefully... the proud beauties are irked. They take you for a weakling, and soon begin to insult you themselves. These haughty characters practically throw themselves into the arms of men who are thoroughly intolerant of others. This is, I think, the only line to take, so that you often have to pick a quarrel with your neighbor to avoid one with your mistress.

Courtship is harder for men because they must show a proper blend of harmlessness and strength.

[]

A prerequisite of love is that a man's face, at first sight, should reveal something to be respected and something to be pitied.

[]

Complacency is in women as in beings of a lesser, perhaps, but finer and lighter species. What a delight to encounter creatures who have their heads always filled with dancing and whims and clothes! They are the charm of all over-tense and serious masculine souls, whose lives are filled with enormous responsibilities.

[]

As you are woman, so be lovely;
As you are lovely, so be various,
Merciful as constant, constant as various,
So be mine, as I yours forever.

[]

Woman is a miracle of divine contradictions.

[]

The core of the feminine mind, no matter how intelligent the woman may be, is occupied by an irrational power....The woman offers the man the magic opportunity of relating with another being without reasoning, of influencing, dominating, surrendering to another, without any reason entering into it.

[]

Why do you always sit at the window? No doubt it makes a pretty picture but a girl walking in the fields also makes a pretty picture...

[]

So bright the tear in Beauty's eye,
Love half regrets to kiss it dry.

[]

A man wasn't bored with that girl, that's for sure!

[]

The birds go to sleep by the sweet wild twist of her song.

[]

Some women, in fact in my experience many women, have a sort of "abstract" quality about them. ...Perhaps this quality is really just unselfishness.

[]

Of praises sung of her she is aware,
Yet clad in sweet humility she goes.

[]

Maidens' hearts are always soft...

[]

She was terrified, shy, shamefaced, and therefore all the more charming.

Men fall in love with deer, with what there is of the deer in a woman.

Auld Nature swears, the lovely dears
Her noblest work she classes, O:
Her prentice han' she tried on man,
An' then she made the lasses, O.

Ursula, in a garden, found
A bed of radishes.
She kneeled upon the ground
And gathered them,
With flowers around,
Blue, gold, pink, and green.

[]

O wild, dark flower of woman,
Deep rose of my desire,
An Eastern wizard made you
Of earth and stars and fire.

[]

There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
At every joint and motive of her body.

[]

...she laughed gaily with that delightful, deep laughter which was one of her chief charms.

[]

...there was an excitement in her voice... a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour... [Her voice] was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it... High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl...

[]

And on the wing
Of her sweet voice, it shall appear
That Love can enter at the ear.

[]

...how should I avoid to be her slave
Whose subtle art invisibly can wreathe
My fetters of the very air I breathe?

[]

You can shine your shoes and wear a suit
You can comb your hair and look quite cute
You can wear a collar and a tie
But one thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside...

[]

...you
Shine like an early drop of dew
Poised on a red rose petal.

[]

Like the touch of rain she was
On a man's flesh and hair and eyes
When the joy of walking thus
Has taken him by surprise

[]

...she had the sparkle of a real diamond among paste.

[]

Thou art so very sweet and fair,
With such a heaven in thine eyes,
It almost seems an overcare
To ask thee to be good or wise.
As if a little bird were blam'd
Because its song unthinking flows;
As if a rose should be asham'd
Of being nothing but a rose.

[]

I'm attracted to men who are ambivalent toward me.

She was so sad and serene, so sweet and yet so withdrawn, that Leon felt himself gripped by a kind of icy enchantment (charme glacial) in her presence, just as one shivers in a church when the fragrance of flowers is mingled with the coldness of marble.

[]

Because of that great nobleness of hers
The fire that stirs about her, when she stirs,
Burns but more clearly.

[]

...the sort of melancholy and the sort of mystery which make women feel for men pity, then quickly love.

[]

You have an elegant gait
competing with the chameleon.

She was a creature that did move more like the sphere
of Mars of Jove of Sol of Love or one more fair.

[]

...a perfect beauty,
she has no blemish;
especially when she is laughing,
I always wish she would laugh again.

I came in as bright as a neon light
And I burned out right there before him...

Exuberance is Beauty.

She was not beautiful but it took her only about ten seconds to persuade people that she was.

[]

...practically none of his features could have been called beautiful by the standards of the sculptor or painter—what one noticed was beauty of another kind—the beauty of expression.

[]

If you would be loved, love and be lovable.

[]

At fifteen, I was able to compose my eyebrows...

[]

She is a beautiful stylish woman, the sort of woman you and I would never normally come within a hundred miles of...

[]

...only God, my dear,
Could love you for yourself alone
And not your yellow hair.

[]

Magic is tangled in a woman's hair
For the entanglement of male pride.

[]

Chain me, chain me, O most fair,
Chain me to thee with that hair!

[]

She opened her eyes, and green
They shone, clear like flowers undone
For the first time, now for the first time seen.

[]

Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee,
The shooting stars attend thee;
And the elves also,
Whose little eyes glow
Like the sparks of fire, befriend thee.

[]

The light that lies
In women's eyes,
Has been my heart's undoing.

[]

From women's eyes this doctrine I derive.
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain, and nourish all the world.

Pale hands I loved beside the Shalimar...

He looked like a statue that had been rubbed with honey and warm wax, to get a golden tone...

Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me.

[]

...one of the most instructive avenues for assessing human evolution would be to attempt a history of the feminine types which have successively been preferred.

[]

I found her slightly sluttish unkempt shabbiness physically attractive.

[]

Robes loosely flowing, hair as free:
Such sweet neglect more taketh me
Than all th'adulteries of art.

[]

Salome always looks for a man who is so different from other men that he seems almost to belong to an unknown sex.

[]

I can't abide men who aren't good-looking.

[]

The type of human being we prefer reveals the contours of our heart... By observing our neighbor in love we are able to deduce his vision or goal in life. And this is the most interesting thing to ascertain: not anecdotes about his existence, but the card upon which he stakes his life.

The ever-lit lamp of the evangelical virgins is the symbol of this virtue which constitutes, as it were, the threshold of love.

[]

Like a sailor in distress, she kept scanning the solitude of her life with anxious eyes, straining to sight some far-off white sail in the mists of the horizon.

[]

One feels desire before knowing the person or situation that satisfies it.

[]

Poor is the life that misses
The lover's greatest treasure,
Innumerable kisses
Which end in endless pleasure.
Oh, then, if this be so,
Shall I a virgin die? Fie no!

[]

...I then felt free to fall in love...

[]

He's just played the tyrant for too long. I must have new love.

[]

An absence of mistrust is not enough; there must be a weariness of mistrusting, and, as it were, courage must be impatient with the hazards of life. You are unconsciously bored by living without loving...

In the unattached heart of a girl who is living in a secluded chateau in the depths of the country, the least touch of surprise arouses profound interest.

[]

In Rome, where day-to-day events provide so little interest, and where outer existence is so lethargic, sensibility accumulates to the benefit of the passions.

The heat of the sun on a summer day
Warms a young girl in an amorous way.

[]

For love to assume its full stature in the heart of man, it [is] necessary that the greatest possible equality should be established between the mistress and her lover.

[]

[Consider] the Benou-Azra, a tribe famous for love throughout all the tribes of Arabia. Their way of loving has become a byword, for God never made other creatures who loved so tenderly.

[]

In Italy, since passion is not infrequent it is not ridiculous and one hears generalizations about love freely quoted in drawing-rooms.

[]

There are many people who would never have been in love if they had never heard love spoken of.

[]

What she felt she could not find words to tell, for she was only a simple girl reared in the fields, and never in her life had ever heard the word: love.

[]

Yesterday evening I heard two delightful little girls of four singing some very lively love-songs as I pushed them in their swing. The chambermaids teach them these songs and their mother tells them that 'love' and 'lover' are meaningless words...

[]

Love's like the measles—all the worse when it comes late in life.

We gotta get you a woman
It's like nothin else to make you
Feel sure you're alive!

An honest farmer was complaining of damage caused in his orchard and I asked him why he did not keep a dog. "My daughters would never marry," was his reply, which I did not understand until he told me that once he had a dog so fierce that none of the boys ever dared to climb through his windows.

[]

What did I know
thinking myself
able to go
alone all the way

[]

All who joy would win
Must share it—Happiness was born a twin.

[]

My room was white with the sun
And Love cried out in me,
"I am strong, I will break your heart
Unless you set me free."

[]

Prudishness is the worst kind of avarice.

[]

A charming woman may... treat a man now with extreme coldness, because she is saving herself for a future lover whom she may never even meet. ...It is as if an orange-tree dared not flower for fear of committing a sin.

[]

A great man is like an eagle; the higher he goes, the less you see of him, and loneliness is the price he pays for being great.

Behold, I too am brave; I too will not stop short of the ideal.

[]

...if somewhere there existed a strong, handsome man with a valorous, passionate and refined nature, a poet's soul in the form of an angel... why was it not possible that she might meet him some day?

[]

The majority of men... have little propensity for passionate love; it would disturb their delightful tranquility; I believe they would regard its transports as unhappiness; certainly they would be humiliated by its shyness.

[]

Little boy, pretty knave, shoot not at random,
For if you hit me, slave, I'll tell your grandam.

[]

I will humble my Beauty, I will not dress fine,
I will keep from the Ball, & my Eyes shall not shine;
And if any Girl's Lover forsakes her for me,
I'll refuse him my hand and from Envy be free.

[]

When is man strong until he feels alone?

[]

I think that every intensely personal life has always had to isolate a fictitious personality, a kind of dermato-psyche to hold off and distract the hostile curiosity of inferior people, in order to be able, behind that bulwark, to devote itself freely to being what it is.

[]

I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.

[]

Whilst I do keep
My harmless sheep
Love hath no power on me:
'Tis idle souls
Which he controls;
The busy man is free.

Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
A long way from my home...

Insomnia, dark circles
poor resistance... disease.

What a woman was there snatched by puritanism from love!


[]

Never even to have touched
The hot blood
Of a soft body,
Doesn't it make you unhappy
You who preach morality?

[]

Oh, is it not enough to be
Here with this beauty over me?
My throat should ache with praise, and I
Should kneel in joy beneath the sky.
...O beauty, are you not enough?
Why am I crying after love?

[]

My heart, being hungry, feeds on food
The fat of heart despise.
Beauty where beauty never stood,
And sweet where no sweet lies
I gather to my querulous need,
Having a growing heart to feed.

'Passionate Love'
I wish to feel a love
Which might be likened to
Burying a hot cheek
In a soft drift of snow.

...sixteen is an age which thirsts for love and is not excessively particular about what beverage chance may provide.

I live all alone, and I am a young girl.
I write long letters and I do not know
anyone to send them to.
Most tender things speak in my heart
And I can only say them to the bamboos in the garden...

[]

Let those love now who never loved before,
Let those who always loved, now love the more.

[]

O Morning Winds that from the garden blow,
Should you meet one like me forlorn and sad,
On him bestow
The peace and solace I have never had.

[]

For this will cure him that is sick, and raise him that is in dumps; one that has loved, it will remember of it; one that has not, it will instruct...

Timeless magic first began
When woman bared her soul to man.

If this be error, and upon me prov'd,
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.
