That spring night I spent
Pillowed on your arm
Never really happened
Except in a dream.
Unfortunately I am
Talked about anyway.

[]

A burning soul does not imagine the ultimate favour, but the nearest one. For example, with a mistress who treats you severely you dream of holding her hand. Imagination does not naturally reach beyond the first step, and if it is forced it will very soon retreat for fear of profaning what it adores.

[]

Let Nature, if she please, disperse
My atoms over all the universe,
At the last they easily shall
Themselves know, and together call;
For thy love, like a mark, is stamped on all.

[]

...the most trivial remarks that he uttered now, even to people who had never heard of her, always somehow related to Odette...

[]

The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
Into his study of imagination,
And every lovely organ of her life,
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
More moving—delicate and full of life
Into the eye and prospect of his soul.

[]

Although my feet
Never cease running to you
On the path of dreams
Such nights of love are never worth
One glimpse of you in your reality.

[]

Good night! Good night! Ah, good the night
That wraps thee in its silver light,
Good night! No night is good for me
That does not hold a thought of thee. Good night!

[]

I arise from dreaming of thee
In the first sweet sleep of night,
When the winds are breathing low,
And the stars are shining bright.

[]

...the love which pervades the whole consciousness and fills it with pictures, some wildly happy, some hopeless, but all sublime...

[]

...as soon as she thought of her future with Vronsky, a dazzling perspective of happiness rose before her...

[]

Each step your imagination takes brings a new delight. Little wonder that this state of mind is enticing.

[]

What a man imagines is, apparently, more important to him than what his flesh experiences.

[]

When you are gone, I stand apart
And whisper to your image in my heart.

[]

She rose up in clouds of brilliant light in his head whenever he came across certain words in his reading. ("Mistress" was one, "beautiful" another...)

[]

I stared ahead of me through the warm silvery veil of my tears and saw Julian's face... hanging there in space, like a vision of the Savior...

[]

The lama's face, in meditation,
Won't seem to come to mind;
But the lover's face unbidden
Floats clearly through my mind.

[]

...I am the veil. The face underneath is hers.

[]

I felt that I was, at every instant, creating Julian and supporting her being with my own.

[]

...simply to think her, as a mystic thinks God with a thought which goes beyond thinking and becomes being.

[]

I drew her like a magnet and she had to come to me.

[]

An' she'd blush scarlet, right in prayer,
When her new meetin'-bonnet
Felt somehow thru' its crown a pair
O' blue eyes sot upon it.

[]

Blow there, sweet Zephyrus!
...and in soft language spoken low,
Thou gentle air, in secret make her know
How, like the phoenix, I do sacrifice
My heart to her, inflame'd by her eyes.

[]

I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.

[]

Before falling in love, I was defined.
Now I am undefined, weeds are growing between my ribs.

[]

...I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.

[]

If you dart forth disdainful rays,
To your own dye you turn my days.

[]

While her breath, speaking, kindled Nature's fire...

[]

...if you are truly in love and your lover says things which make you happy, you will lose the power of speech.

[]

Her use of my name nearly sent me spinning off into the water. I wanted suddenly to turn right round like someone in a dance. I think I gave a sort of gasp.

[]

As they walked down the street she turned her eyes towards me where I stood in fear and trembling, and with her ineffable courtesy, which is now rewarded in eternal life, she greeted me! and such was the virtue of her greeting that I seemed to experience the height of bliss.

[]

...she said to me
Jack, Jack, different than I had ever heard,
Because she wasn't calling me, I think,
Or telling me. She used my name to
Talk in another way I wanted to know.

[]

He looked at me when I passed
and my heart was in jubilee.

[]

...but for an instant, as she glanced at [Vronsky], her eyes lit up and though the fire was at once extinguished, that one instant made him happy.

[]

...her smile, which always transported Levin into an enchanted world where he felt softened, and overflowing with tenderness, as he remembered feeling on rare occasions in his early childhood.

[]

Le Bret: You are not quite so gloomy.
Cyrano: After all, she knows that I exist—no matter why!

[]

There was, it would seem, nothing extraordinary in what she had said, but what unutterable meaning there was in every sound of her words, in every movement of her lips, eyes, and hands as she said it!

[]

His actual presence disturbed the voluptuous pleasure of her reveries.

[]

There is a solitude in seeing you,
Followed by your presence when you are gone.
You are like heaven's veins of lightning.
I cannot see till afterward
How beautiful you are.
There is a blindness in seeing you,
Followed by the sight of you when you are gone.

[]

Mouse, why do you whisper love in your heart all day?
Why do you talk about her, incessantly,
All the time, any time
Except when she is present in the flesh?

[]

...did you... think of nothing but to read in her eyes what she thought of you at that moment, so that you had no thought of conveying your love for her through your own glances?

[]

...she searched his face for signs of the impression she was making on him.

[]

She was filled with indignation when she saw that big red hand, its fingers as soft as slugs, touching those pages that had once made her heart pound with emotion.

[]

I won't wash it—
The dress he gave me;
Love's past
would fade.

[]

One evening at a party he kissed her hand; and you will observe that since then she has been careful, even at the risk of appearing odd, to allow no one else to kiss her hand.

[]

I had put Julian's chair well out of the way.

[]

...she lingers
There, like sunshine over the ground...

[]

I have kept your churi under my pillow so that I have your flavour all the time with me.

[]

...I was sitting on the floor hugging the chair which she had sat in.

[]

Thou more than most sweet glove,
Unto my more sweet love,
Suffer me to store with kisses
This empty lodging that now misses
The pure rosy hand that ware thee...

[]

Where the Chikuma flows through Shinama,
If but on the pebbles you tread,
I will gather them up, like precious gems
From the river bed.

[]

As if two wax candles were so close together that the light were all one.

[]

...an untiring instinct for migration, a wild urge to depart from oneself to the other. ...this constant state of migration is what it is to be in love.

[]

...a feeling of being absorbed by him to the core of our being, as if he had torn us from our own vital depths and we were living trees transplanted, our vital roots within him.

[]

...lots and lots of things weren't real to me at all until I'd told you about them.

[]

I was also aware of myself filling up with all kinds of things I wanted to tell her.

[]

...genuine sexual love, that is, ardor for another being, his body and soul in indissoluble union, is in itself primarily a gigantic force entrusted with improving the species.

[]

The most genuine lovers will truthfully admit that they did not feel—at least, initially—a desire for physical union.

[]

One day I will kiss you so
that the flowers tremble.

[]

This cup has touched
Zenophila's teasing mouth, sweet snare of love.
Oh happiness, if she
Would press her lips to my lips, and in one
Deep draught drink down my soul!

[]

Appetite [as opposed to love] ...does not result in surrender of oneself, but, on the contrary, in the capture of the object.

[]

She seems to be your property, because you alone can make her happy.

[]

I wish I was an apple
A-hangin on a tree
And every time my true love passed
She'd take a bite of me!

[]

A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice

[]

Yourself—your soul—in pity give me all,
Withhold no atom's atom or I die...

[]

When, far down the street, he saw a white satin hat that looked like the one Mme ... wore, his heart missed a beat, and he had to lean against the wall for support.

[]

...my heart suddenly nearly fell out of me because the telephone rang and I thought it might be her. [Then] the front doorbell rang. My heart performed the same swoop into emptiness.

[]

And oh, the towering feel-ing!
Just to know, somehow you are near!
The o-verpowering feel-ing
That any moment, you may suddenly, appear!

[]

...he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility of her sudden apparition...

[]

Forget the rest: my heart is true
And in its waking thought of you
Gives the same wild and sudden leap
That jerks it from the brink of sleep.

[]

If you come to me
Moonbeams fill my room.

[]

A thrilling current of sheer joy came from the woman beside me and warmed my whole body and made it tingle with well-being.

[]

He knew she was there by the joy and terror that gripped his heart.

[]

And if perchance by me there pass
She unto whom I sue for grace,
The cold blood forsaketh my face...

[]

Ah, my pretty jewel
I love you as a pig loves the mud.

[]

If I could share this old moondance with you, my love.

[]

I want to be the Moon
And shine
On the bed
Where he sleeps.

[]

I wish I were close
To you as the wet skirt of
A salt girl to her body.
I think of you always.

[]

Just like an angel,
beautiful without blemish,
how can I stay away from you?

[]

...even the thought of leaving Florence [Italy] makes him feel he is dying.

[]

Merely to run toward you is cool water
For a man who is thirsty.

[]

I do not feel ashamed
to follow you wherever you are.

[]

Ideally, there should be no kindness in the role of either the man or the woman. Self-seeking, in one of the paradoxes with which love abounds, they find each other.

[]

Love seeketh only self to please,
To bind another to Its delight,
Joys in another's loss of ease,
And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite.

[]

The plain English of the politest address of a gentleman to a lady, is, I am now, dear madam, the humblest of your servants: Be so good as to allow me to be your Lord and Master.

[]

Self-love, my love, no farther goes than this,
that when we kiss, it is ourselves we kiss.

[]

Love is nothing save an insatiate thirst to enjoy a greedily desired object.

[]

...not to flatter ourselves, ours is but a refined degree of madness. What can it be else to be lost to all things in the world but that single object that takes up one's fancy, to lose all the quiet and repose of one's life in hunting after it, when there is so little likelihood of ever gaining it...?

[]

But even if a man or a woman were so fine and so wise that their claim to be such could be denied by no one, it would still be a form of madness to direct upon him or upon her the kind of exclusive worshipping attention in which being in love consists.

[]

Crazy you call me
Sure I'm crazy
Crazy in love with you.

[]

Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, desires a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too.

[]

The ecstatic is more or less a madman. He lacks moderation and mental clarity.

[]

Were it not reasonably common, men could surely be locked up for such a change of consciousness.

[]

I was dreadfully in love with the sort of black certain metaphysical love that cuts deeper than anything, and thus seems its own absolute justification.

[]

What is done from love is always beyond good and evil.

[]

Mine Eyes the Glasse, the Needle is my Soule,
Love is the Loadstone, My beloved the Pole.

[]

...all the happiness of his life, the sole meaning of his life, he now found in seeing and hearing her.

[]

Fog clings
To the high mountain
My eye clings
to him.

[]

To see you, little one,
that is my need,
my heart presses inside me,
I cannot wait.

[]

Ne joy of aught that under heaven doth hove,
Can comfort me, but her own joyous sight.

[]

For heaven itself I should not care
Unless I saw Clorinda there.

[]

Thou sweet kindler of desires.

[]

...to the Don Juans I will say this, that a man in fear and trembling is never bored. The pleasures of love are always in proportion to the fear.

[]

When I see a man being sad I believe he is falling in love.

[]

The soul of a man in love smells of the closed-up room of a sick man—its confined atmosphere is filled with stale breath.

[]

...my natural spirit began to be impeded in its functioning, for my soul was wholly given to thoughts of this most gracious person. In a short time I grew so frail and weak that many of my friends felt concern at my appearance.

[]

He who is not impatient is not in love.

[]

...the tension of waiting... so ravished and stripped bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea, not one memory in his mind behind which his troubled spirit might take shelter and repose...

[]

When you are to meet your beloved in the evening, the anticipation of such immense happiness makes the intervening minutes quite unbearable.

[]

The green sickness of love.

[]

Love is always pictured as naked.

[]

Symptoms of true love
Are leanness, jealousy,
Laggard dawns;
Are omens and nightmares—
Listening for a knock,
Waiting for a sign.

[]

Why does love have to make you feel weak?

[]

The night is unbearable,
Oh, let me go to you
For there is no one,
There is nothing
To comfort me but you.

[]

Many a time she made me die...

[]

Love in my bosom like a bee
Doth suck his sweet...

[]

Now Love that dissolves the limbs shakes me,
Sweetly bitter unvanquishable creeping thing.

[]

Once I had friends, now none are left to me;
I see none else but you, because my heart Has wholly fled to you,
And thus I walk the ways of Earth apart.

[]

Because your voice was at my side
I gave him pain.
Because within my hand I held
Your hand again.

There is no word nor any sign
Can make amend—
He is a stranger to me now
Who was a friend.

[]

My dear Nora, It has just struck me. I came in at half past eleven. Since then I have been sitting in an easy chair like a fool. I could do nothing. I hear nothing but your voice. I am like a fool hearing you call me 'Dear.' I offended two men today by leaving them coolly. I wanted to hear your voice, not theirs.

[]

My thought is like the stream; and flows and follows you on forever.

[]

My thoughts seek you as waves that seek the shore,
And when I think of you, I am at rest.

[]

...the thought of his absent mistress was incessantly, indissolubly blended with all the simple actions of Swann's daily life—when he took his meals, opened his letters, went for a walk or to bed—by the very sadness he felt at having to perform those actions without her; like those initials of Philibert the Fair which, in the church of Brou, because of her grief and longing for him, Margaret of Austria intertwined everywhere with her own.

[]

She was [for him] the amorous heroine of all novels and plays, the vague 'she' of all poetry.

[]

In all the novels I read, his idea accompanied me & I did little else from morning to night but read novels.

[]

And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,
Love itself shall slumber on.

[]

I love her more than skies bright with the wind and sun
and all my thoughts arise
to travel, one by one,
into her lips and eyes.

[]

The dawning of morn, the daylight's sinking,
The night's long hours still find me thinking
Of thee, thee, only thee.

[]

Throughout all these absurdities... I had not for a second stopped thinking about Kitty. The thought of her now filled out about me like a great vibrating sphere.

[]

At about half past three I went to bed and to sleep, and the thought of Kitty spread a tent of quietness above my dreaming head.

[]

The lover's every action ends with the thought of the beloved... A person in love is unremittingly and uninterruptedly occupied with the image of the beloved.

[]

A man does not have the stamina
to put love aside.

[]

And all is dross that is not Helena.

[]

"Ambition? Society? The Court?" There was nothing that interested him there. They had all had a meaning for him once, but now he no longer cared for any of it.

[]

With single Love Ile feed my breast
That so on double it may feast
When you love mee mee best.

[]

I wanna be loved by you
Just you and nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you alone

[]

Now Since an Object I have gain'd
Whereon to sett & fix my heart
My wandringe thoughts are all restrain'd
I feele no Rack of doubtfull Smart
I would not for a Kingdome be
Redeem'd from this Captivitye Of loveing thee

[]

...nothing in this wide universe I call,
Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.

[]

It was as if there was no one in the universe except me and Kitty.

[]

When one has just seen the woman one loves, the sight of every other woman damages the vision and physically hurts the eyes...

[]

He will prefer to dream of the slenderest chance of pleasing her, rather than to receive all the favours of any femme vulgaire.

[]

The man whose heart has leapt at the glimpse of his beloved's white satin hat in the distance is surprised at his own indifference to the greatest society beauty...

[]

There was only one being in the world who was able to concentrate for him the whole world and the meaning of life.

[]

A sign of love has just struck me; it is when all the pleasures and all the pains attributable to all the other passions and all the other needs of a man cease abruptly to affect him.

[]

...falling in love burns away conflicting emotions...

[]

"Falling in love" is a phenomenon of attention.

[]

And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,
Your own glass shows you when you look at it.

[]

All measure, and all language, I should pass,
Should I tell what a miracle she was.

[]

...I sometimes hold my tongue,
Because I would not dull you with my song.

[]

Every child from the bazaar was singing his verses; every passer-by was humming one of his love-songs, bringing Layla a message from her beloved, whether they knew it or not.

[]

Of these songs you yourself well know how some have become widely known and have been sung in many lands...

[]

...in black ink my love may still shine bright.

[]

No man ever forgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain, which created all things new; which was the dawn in him of music, poetry, and art.

[]

I know love
not from books,
nor have I got it from hearsay,
from others who have experienced it.
Love has been granted
in its wonderful sweetness.

[]

For a great painter or a great poet love is divine because it multiplies a hundredfold the scope and the pleasures of the art which gives his soul its daily bread.

[]

The nightingale
cannot help singing,
for she sparkles with love in her whole being...

[]

Love was glowing in him. When it burst into flames it also took hold of his tongue...

[]

She had filled me with a previously unimaginable power which I knew that I would and could use in my art.

[]

At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet.

[]

"We ask you to tell us in what this joy of yours resides!" And I, in reply to her, said this: "In words which praise my lady."

[]

Tune on my pipe the praises of my Love,
And, midst thy oaten harmony, recount
How fair she is that makes thy music mount
And every string of thy heart's harp to move.

[]

An air of coolness plays upon his face,
And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.
And then he thinks he knows,
The hills where his life rose,
And the sea where it goes.

[]

The woman in love has the conviction, for which we all long, that her life is unified, that it has direction and meaning, that its direction is toward, and its meaning suffused with, the truth, that in love she transcends time and makes herself one with forces which are eternal.

[]

The sense of being absolutely in the right and longed-for place.

[]

My salvation lay in her because I saw that she was filled with the joy of living...

[]

[He] persisted in connecting all his dreams of artistical success with Annie's image...

[]

When a'body's thochts is set on his ain salvation,
Mine's set on you.

[]

...my love, the medicine of my heart...

[]

Your hand was honey-comb to heal,
Your voice a web to bind.
You were a Mending flower to me
To cure my heart and mind.

[]

It was like being seen by God. She bathed my hurt soul in a reviving dew.

[]

I am come to her wonder
Like a boy finding a star in a haymow
And there is nothing cruel or mad or evil
Anywhere.

[]

Let Phyllis be mine, and but ever be kind,
I could to a desert with her be confined,
And envy no monarch his reign.

[]

My only need—you ask me, and I tell you—
Is that henceforth forever you exist.

[]

I am simply happy that you exist... proud to live with you in the same city, in the same century...

[]

Now your source of joy has been revealed.

[]

To see her among others, straying like a divine form among mortals, is to become faint with secret knowledge.

[]

A person
in love
lives not off himself
but off the other,
as a child,
before birth,
lives bodily off its mother...

[]

There is no doubt that love is continually being fed; it derives nourishment from the beloved's charms, which it beholds either in reality or in imagination.

[]

So true a fool is love that in your will,
Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.

[]

With all thy faults, I love thee still.

[]

It is enough if there is some perfection in him...

[]

The projection of imaginary qualities upon a real object is a constant phenomenon. In man, to see things—moreover, to appreciate them!—always means to complete them.

[]

La Ghita is certainly no more than a pretext for all the raptures of this poor German...

[]

Each step your imagination takes brings a new delight. Little wonder that this state of mind is enticing.

[]

Love is the only passion which rewards itself in a coin of its own manufacture.

[]

Once you begin to examine your lover, it is no longer a case of passionate but of mannered love.

[]

Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind.

[]

...beauty can only suggest probabilities about a woman and about her self-possession (sang-froid). But the eyes of your pockmarked mistress are a wonderful reality which makes nonsense of all possible probabilities.

[]

"...from the first moment I became your servant no thought has entered my heart but that you are the best that ever was born, and the truest in words and seeming."

[]

...for Levin all the girls in the world were divided into two classes: one class included all the girls in the world except her and all of them had all the human weaknesses, and all of them were very ordinary; the other class contained Kitty alone, a girl who had no weaknesses of any kind and who was above the rest of humanity.

[]

Before the nature of an object can produce its proper sensation in them, they have blindly invested it from afar with imaginary charm which they conjure up inexhaustibly within themselves.

[]

O brave new world,
That has such people in't!

[]

Only once in our lives do we love with our whole heart[s] a being whom we cannot do without: a gaping abyss separates that being from the rest of mankind.

[]

...yet you will saye, theres nought can be
whyte, softe or sweet that is not she.

[]

If ever any beauty I did see,
Which I desir'd, and got, 'twas but a dreame of thee.

[]

O Queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.

[]

Love generates, or rather reveals, something which may be called absolute charm.

[]

...there was a truth somewhere which denied Kitty, only I loved Kitty more than that truth...

[]

...it was not unlike me to imbue other people, on occasion, with qualities that I desperately wanted them to have.

[]

But love is blind and lovers cannot see
The pretty follies that themselves commit.

[]

Love is the state in which man sees things most decidedly as they are not.

[]

Our friend with the great soul...

[]

Paradise is your abode,
on earth you are suffering.

[]

Dearest Mary pure and holey meek and loly lovely Rose of Sharon...

[]

I cannot rise to follow her,
Here in the dust is my abode,
For I am but her foot-print left
Lying forgotten in the road.

[]

No man could think base thoughts who looked on her...

[]

Serene and serious, still and quaint,
She's partly woman, partly saint,
This Presbyterian beauty.

[]

I'm glad that it was not my chance to live
Till as that heavenly creature first was born,
Who as an angel doth the earth adorn
And buried virtue in the tomb revive:
For vice overflows the world with such a flood,
That in it all, save she, there is no good.

[]

If in your face, divine effects I view,
Ah, who can blame me, if I worship you?

[]

Yet enlisting hope doth woe me
To think one woman may be true
And in your Angells shape comes to me
Oh God what power then rests in you.

[]

Her breath is life, her eyes are day,
And all mankind her creatures are.

[]

The moon wooed the lotus in the night
The lotus was wooed by the moon
And my sweetheart is their child
The blossom opened in the night
And she came forth
The petals moved and she was born.

[]

Her lips' remark was: "Oh, you kid!"
Her soul spoke thus (I know it did):
"O king of realms of endless joy,
My own, my golden grocer's boy."

[]

If all, so much as I, your music love
The whole world would at your devotion move...

[]

When I look at you with my eyes,
be the coolness of my eye.

[]

He makes my eyes cool with his smile.

[]

...perfect music has the same effect on the heart as the presence of the beloved.

[]

For your sweet beauty, daintily transfused
With due proportion throughout every part,
What is it but a dance where Love hath used
His finer cunning and more curious art;
Where all the elements themselves impart,
And turn, and wind, and mingle with such measure,
That th'eye that sees it, surfeits with the pleasure?

[]

When he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.

[]

...what I feel,
Here in this room, desiring you,
Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk
is music.

[]

As soft as down: and were she down
Jove might come down and kiss
A love so fresh, so sweet, so white,
So smooth, so soft, as this.

[]

More than most fair, full of that heavenly fire
Kindled above to show the Maker's glory
Beauty's first born, in whom all powers conspire
to write the Graces' life, and Muses' story!

[]

A thousand Cupids fly
About her gentle eye.
From which each throws a dart
that kindleth soft sweet fire
Within my sighing heart
Possessed by desire...

[]

When she a little smiles, her aspect then
No tongue can tell, no memory can hold,
So rare and strange a miracle is she.

[]

Beautie's the soule of humane Excellence,
the Eyes blest object, rapture of the sence,
Vertue's most glorious Garment, lov's rich shryne,
Earths onely Phoenix, natures worke divine,
the Common Idoll of All harts, o then,
beauty that masters gods must Conquer Men.

[]

So light is my mistress, so graceful is she,
I tremble lest the breath of the evening
woo her from me...

[]

...the perfume I adore
That clings to thee

[]

She lilts a low soft language, and I hear
Down long sea-chambers of the inner ear.

[]

Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,
'Tis a woman's whole existence.

[]

A man completes a woman in a way, alas for him—and for her—in which she cannot complete him. He arises from her arms, his hunger for joint-stock companies, turbo jets, and plantations on the moon unappeased. While she has him, her sun. What does the moon and outer space mean to her?

[]

Love, an episode in the life of man, is the entire story of the life of woman.

[]

When the state of "being in love"... is sought for itself, or prolonged for itself, or valued for itself, there is an autoeroticism of the emotions more arid and damaging than any physical autoeroticism.

[]

The woman may not yet love... the man or boy who has elicited these feelings; but she does love the person she has become: a woman purified by love's focusing... No woman, if given a choice of inscriptions for her tombstone, would choose "Mary Jones, a greatly loved woman" rather than "Mary Jones, a greatly loving woman."

[]

In Geneva and France, ...girls fall in love at sixteen in order to make a novel out of life, and at each step, almost at each tear, they ask themselves: 'Am I not just like Julie d'Etanges?'

[]

...when a man really loves he rejoices or trembles no matter what he thinks about... Now rejoicing and trembling are interesting activities beside which all others pale. ...Nothing is so interesting as passion; everything about it is unexpected, and its agent is also its victim.

[]

It should be remembered that a person under the stress of strong emotions seldom has time to notice the emotions of whoever is causing them.

[]

In her first passion woman loves her lover,
In all the others all she loves is love.

[]

The love of the wife for the husband is not for the sake of the husband but for the sake of the self; the love of the husband for the wife is not for the sake of the wife but for the sake of the self.

[]

Oh don't be so gay and flippant, you look so horribly pleased with yourself, what's the matter?

[]

Love cannot be anything but egotistical.

[]

...the impression she had made on him filled him with happiness and pride.

[]

...my marvelous achievement of absolute love.

[]

The pleasure of love lies in loving; we are happier in the passion we feel than in that we inspire.

[]

Terrible and sublime thought, that every moment is supreme for some man and woman, every hour the apotheosis of some passion!

[]

There are no age limits for love. 

[]

...it is one of the peculiarities, perhaps one of the blessings, of this planet that anyone can experience this transformation of the world. Also, anyone can be its object.

[]

...love is an infrequent occurrence, a sentiment which only certain souls can hope to experience: in fact, a specific talent which some individuals possess... Almost all men and women live submerged in the sphere of their own interests (some without doubt, beautiful and respectable), and are incapable of feeling the migratory urge toward what is outside themselves.

[]

Let us cease believing that the measure of a man's love lies in how stupid he has become or is willing to be.

[]

The mistress of a house knows that her maid has fallen in love when she begins to notice that the maid is distracted.

[]

Are the stars out tonight?

[]

I had just uttered Julian's name aloud.

[]

And what was our disease we could not tell.

[]

Have you got softening of the brain?

[]

...I noticed he often spoke without knowing what he was saying or to whom he was saying it.

[]

Sleep with her one night and you're mixed up
seven days after.

[]

She smiled contemptuously and took up her book again, but this time she could not understand a word of what she was reading.... The tension... reached such a point that she was afraid every minute that something would snap within her under the intolerable strain.

[]

O, love, love, love!
Love is like a dizziness;
It winna let a poor body
Gang about his business!

[]

O my stars how you undo me!
O my stars...

[]

A sensitive man, once his heart is stirred, loses all memory of habit as a guide to action; how can he keep on the track when he has lost the scent?

[]

I watch the red buds turn to green leaves.
My thoughts are many and tumultuous,
As troubled as the tossing branches,
All for thinking of you.

[]

His senses are confused, because for him this jewel is the eye of the world.

[]

Beauty the god of wisdome can confound,
not one of all the Gods, hath scapt that wound.

[]

Strange is the journey that my soul by wanton Love was led,
Two steps were straight and clear, and four forgotten
were instead.

[]

...then my spirits were so routed by the power which Love acquired on finding himself so close to this most gracious being that none survived except the spirits of vision... A number of the women present, observing my transformation, began to be astonished and, talking about it, they mocked at me in company with the most gracious one herself.

[]

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die...
(And I love her)

[]

If I love thee not, chaos is come again.

[]

Not one word, not one gesture of yours will I ever forget, nor can I ever forget.

[]

Nothing can ever extinguish the love for you in my heart. It is a riddle without a solution, a code which none can decipher...

[]

I love thee, I love but thee,
With a love that cannot die
Till the sun grows cold,
And the stars are old,
And the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold!

[]

My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.

[]

On thee, dainty dear life, my love is fixed.

[]

The foreverness of real love is one of the reasons why even unrequited love is a source of joy.

[]

There's a hammer in my heart
Pounding out your name...!

[]

...my heart was beating Kitty tomorrow, Kitty tomorrow.

[]

[He went to a certain restaurant] only for one of those reasons, at once mystical and absurd, which people call 'romantic'; because this restaurant bore the same name as the street in which Odette lived: La Pe'rouse.

[]

Everything in the world was Julian.

[]

O my dove, thou art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs...

[]

Why did the fragrance of the flowers outflow
If not to breathe with benediction sweet
Across her path? Why did the soft wind blow
If not to kiss the ground before her feet?

[]

A lover sees the woman he loves in every skyline, and as he travels a hundred leagues to catch a momentary glimpse of her each tree, each rock speaks to him in a different way and teaches him something new about her.

[]

Not from the whole wide world I chose thee—
Sweetheart, light of the land and the sea!
The wide, wide world could not inclose thee,
For thou art the whole wide world to me.

[]

The sight of everything that is extremely beautiful, in Nature and in the arts, calls up the image of your beloved like a flash of lightning.

[]

If I look on a wildflower I see her face there...

[]

Tree you are,
Moss you are,
You are violets with wind above them.

[]

My beloved
Must be coming this evening.
For the behavior
Of the spiders on the bamboo grass
Is striking this evening.

[]

...where her heart beats, there is my home.

[]

Love is space and time made directly perceptible to the heart.

[]

...her presence gave the house what none of the other houses that he visited seemed to possess: a sort of nervous system, a sensory network which ramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his heart.

[]

...the supreme sign of true love: being close to what is loved, in a more profound contact and proximity than that of space.

[]

We are with [our friend] in a symbolic union—our soul seems to expand miraculously, to clear the distance, and no matter where he is, we feel that we are in essential communion with him.

[]

Love is where the glory falls
Of Thy face—on convent walls
Or on the tavern floors, the same
Unextinguishable flame.

[]

I have often walked
Down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I
Several storeys high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live...

[]

For love, all love of other sights controls,
And makes one little room, an everywhere.

[]

A common though not invariable early phase of this madness... is a false loss of self, which can be so extreme that all fear of pain, all sense of time (time is anxiety, is fear) is utterly blotted out.

[]

Time had already become eternity. There was a huge warm globe of conscious being within which I moved with extreme slowness...

[]

I had to load somebody with presents.

[]

I glowed with a flame of charity which moved me to forgive all who had ever injured me...

[]

There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear.

[]

I was purged of resentment and of hate, purged of all the mean anxious fears that compose the vile ego.

[]

And when love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.

[]

...I gazed out with wide peaceful eyes at a world devoid of evil.

[]

...love makes one calmer about many things...

[]

I felt as if I should never need to eat again, but could live indefinitely simply by breathing.

[]

Love is enough: though the World be a-waning...

[]

Love is the perfect sum
Of all delight.

[]

Dear joy, how I do love thee!

[]

When I was small I was gay, but it has taken me nearly all the years in between to recover it, because no one allowed me to believe it until you gave it back to me.

[]

There is a sense of one's own face as stretched, as thinned, which goes with extreme joy. I felt as if my face were simply a stretched skin, the features vanished, the pure radiance blazing through.

[]

All mankind love a lover.

[]

Brad, what is it, you look extraordinary, something's happened to you, you're beautiful, you look like a saint or something, you look like some goddamn picture, you look all young again—

[]

It was not the words, nor the melody,
Not the beat, nor the pace;
It was that slow suspension of our breathing
As we watched your face,
And the grace-notes, unrecordable on the clef,
Sung only by a spirit in grace.

[]

Love teaches even asses to dance.

[]

...passion gives a strength above nature, we see it in mad people...

[]

I—I am going to be a storm—a flame—
I need to fight whole armies all alone;
I have ten hearts; I have a hundred arms; I feel
Too strong to war with mortals—BRING ME GIANTS!

[]

He moved without any effort of his muscles and felt that he could do anything. He was sure that, if necessary, he could fly upward or lift the corner of a house.

[]

I could have danced all night
I could have danced all night
And still have begged for more...

[]

There seemed to be no gravity in the park that morning.

[]

If I were a bell
I'd go ding dong ding dong ding!

[]

The heart that loves is always young.

[]

Love in its essence is spiritual fire.

[]

The woman in love... renews herself by becoming, once again, as the young are, a person who sees in another rare virtues and graces.

[]

I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

[]

O happy race of men, if love, which rules Heaven, rule your minds!

[]

In love, realities obligingly rearrange themselves to conform with desire.

[]

Yea, to such freshness, fairness, fulness, fineness, freeness,
Love lures life on.

[]

If I have freedom in my love,
And in my soul am free;
Angels alone that soar above
Enjoy such liberty.

[]

Passionate love spreads all Nature in her sublimity before a man's eyes, like something invented only yesterday. He is surprised never to have noticed the strange sights he now perceives.

[]

Love a` la Werther opens the mind to all the arts, to all sweet and romantic impressions, moonlight, the beauty of the woods and of painting, in a word, to the feeling and enjoyment of the beautiful, in whatever form it presents itself, even the humblest. It shows the way to happiness even without riches.

[]

...his first impulse was to thank Heaven for rendering him again the being of thought, imagination, and keenest sensibility that he had long ceased to be.

[]

And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming, O then I was happy,
O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food nourish'd me more, and the beautiful day pass'd well.

[]

Music I heard with you was more than music,
And bread I broke with you was more than bread.

[]

Tonight, the world looks like a different place...

[]

And there I asked...
What change you'd wrought in graveyard, rock and sea,
This new wild paradise to wake for me...

[]

And every sound that meets the ear is Love.

[]

This shifting House of Mirrors
where we dwell
Under Thy charm a fairy palace seems...

[]

I tell thee Love is Nature's second sun,
Causing a spring of virtues where he shines.

[]

What life is there, what delight, without golden Aphrodite?

[]

Love, the bright atmosphere, the vital air,
Of youth; without it life and death are one.

[]

Everything became bright in her presence.

[]

...give light sweet light to me, & lett me shyne by thee...

[]

I am all on fire with new-wakened love...

[]

Last night, when some one spoke his name,
From my swift blood that went and came
A thousand little shafts of flame
Were shiver'd in my narrow frame.

[]

'Ecstasy of Chaos'
When the immense drugged universe explodes
In a cascade of unendurable colour
And leaves us gasping naked,
This is no more than ecstasy of chaos:
Hold fast, with both hands, to the royal love
Which alone, as we know certainly, restores
Fragmentation into true being.

[]

It was as if stars were exploding in front of my eyes so that I literally could not see.

[]

You came upon me like a landslide
Once in a while I can take it like that
And I like it...

[]

Don't push your foot on the heartbrake!

[]

...the irreproachable secret
Of love, which is: never to turn back.

[]

...one must be faithful to one's destiny.

[]

You're the one that I want! (Oooh, hooo hooo...!)

[]

Love is the proudest of despots: it is either everything or nothing.

[]

Love, for the deadly sins are seven,
Only through love will you enter heaven.

[]

Give all to love;
Obey thy heart;
[...]
Nothing refuse.
'Tis a brave master;
Let it have scope:
Follow it utterly...

[]

When love walks in the room
Everybody stand up!
Oooooh, it's good! good! good!
Say Iloveyou!Iloveyou!Iloveyou!Iloveyou!Iloveyou!!!

[]

...overwhelmed and dead, almost
I stumbled on your secret door
Which saves the live man from the ghost.

[]

All I remember is I saw you look at me
And I couldn't breathe and I hurt so bad I couldn't see.

[]

He went down, trying not to look long at her, as though she were the sun, but he saw her, as one sees the sun, without looking.

[]

I dare not gaze upon her face.

[]

The only victory over love is flight.

[]

...we are as deeply afraid to live and to love as we are to die.

[]

The weak individual... fears the unexpected, which life may hold enveloped in the folds of her billowing skirt...

[]

I dare not ope the door.
To hear the sweet birds sing
Oft proves a dangerous thing.

[]

...whoever falls in love does so because he wants to fall in love.

[]

Love does not ask
when it seizes a man.

[]

...the fundamental surrender is not carried out on the plane of will, but occurs more deeply within the person.

[]

Love is like a fever which comes and goes quite independently of the will.

[]

It is not mere feeling, but a sort of force outside me which has taken possession of me.

[]

How strange the turns of Love's unending game,
For neither Lover nor Beloved lit
The ever-burning flame:
Whence was the spirit that enkindled it?

[]

I felt as if my stomach had ben shot away, leaving a gaping hole.

[]

The moment I saw her I say in all truth that the vital spirit, which dwells in the inmost depths of the heart, began to tremble so violently that I felt the vibration alarmingly in all my pulses, even the weakest of them.

[]

Falling in love is, in fact, an enchantment; Tristan's magic potion has always symbolized with suggestive plasticity the psychological process of love.

[]

Incipit vita nova: here begins a new life.

[]

Behold a god more powerful than I, who comes to rule over me.

[]

Whoever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?

[]

I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met...

[]

I ne'er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete...

[]

How has my bird-like soul been stricken low,
Pierced to the very heart!
My love has used instead of bolt and bow
A deadlier dart.

[]

Love wakes men, once a lifetime each;
They lift their heavy lids, and look...

[]

It needs only a very small quantity of hope to give birth to love.

[]

It's odd to think we might have been
Sun, moon and stars unto each other—
Only, I turned down one little street
And you went up another.

[]

...the mind of the lover abhors accident... surely it was lovers who discovered astrology... My love for Julian must have been figured before the world began... When God said, "Let there be light," this love was made.

[]

Yet when I heard your name that first far time
It seemed like other names to me, and I
Was all unconscious, as a dreaming river
That nears at last its long predestined sea...

[]

There is a lady sweet and kind,
Was never face so pleased my mind;
I did but see her passing by,
And yet I love her till I die.

[]

That beautiful pale face is my fate.

[]

What was it that controlled me?
What kept my love-life lean?
My intuition told me
You'd come on the scene.

[]

Crushes. I love crushes. There's always somebody new. You see someone handsome on the bus, fantasize, fall in love, then the bus stops and you get off. It lasts five minutes, then it's over—the perfect relationship. I don't have time for anything else.

[]

'Love at first sight,' some say, misnaming
Discovery of twinned helplessness
Against the huge tug of procreation.
But friendship at first sight? This also
Catches fiercely at the surprised heart
So that the cheek blanches and then blushes.

[]

The heart has its reasons which the reason does not know.

[]

The woman who resembles us is antipathic: what we seek in the other sex is the opposite of ourselves.

[]

Love is but the discovery of ourselves in others, and the delight in the recognition.

[]

Madam, I have been looking for a person who disliked gravy all my life; let us swear eternal friendship.

[]

O cricket is to cricket dear,
and ant for ant doth long.

[]

At Sunday dinner, with your defenses down
I fell in love...

[]

To let the value of your gifts decrease will seem to express a decline in interest.

[]

It was the first time he had ever bought flowers for a woman, when he smelled them his chest swelled with pride, as though this tribute intended for someone else had turned back upon himself.

[]

Buffalo gal, won't you come out tonight
and dance by the light of the moon?

[]

Mm Mm Mm Would you like to take a walk?
Mm Mm Mm Do you think it's gonna rain?
Mm Mm Mm How about a sasparilla?
Gee the moon is yeller
Sump'n good'll come from that!

Johnny had said when I first met him how he had always had, like, these problems with women, and at the time I dug him so much for saying that because I thought: aw, hey, this guy's just like me. Which is to say he lacked confidence in himself as a person. Or, to put it another way, he did not know who he really was as a man, just like I did not know who I really was as a woman. And so we could start from scratch, the two of us, and find out together.

[]

Del Rosso insists upon a woman who... gives him the opportunity and incentive to display his particular brand of charm.

[]

We are carefully watching each other,
We are prowling through casual speech,
We are drifting towards reefs through the smother
Of each one's awareness of each.
We are jockeying now for position,
We are dropping the duellist's glove,
We are tempting the cruel perdition
Of something called love.

[]

Sometimes I think I must send out vibrations that say, 'calling all rats, calling all rats'!

[]

...some kindly sentiment... would flash from her eyes like a ray of gold.

[]

Jeepers Creepers! Where'd you get those peepers?
Jeepers Creepers! Where'd you get those eyes?

[]

I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
Them there eyes!

[]

Glances are the big guns of the virtuous coquette; everything can be conveyed in a look, and yet that look can always be denied, because it cannot be quoted word for word.

[]

Mystical grammar of amorous glances...

[]

I, with whose eyes her eyes committed theft

[]

The very sensitive need a woman to be easy of access if crystallization is to be encouraged.

[]

...so beautiful and proud that all men fear her...

[]

...beauty is so full of pride.

[]

Tell me, is there any part of me
That is not loveable?

[]

...here was the sort of... girl who could bestow indescribable benefits on any young man she liked—and on his confidence.

[]

If the heart of a man is deprest with cares,
The mist is dispell'd when a woman appears;
Like the notes of a fiddle she sweetly, sweetly
Raises the spirits, and charms our ears.

[]

Beauty is only the promise of happiness.

[]

The saying that beauty is but skin deep is but a skin deep saying.

[]

The normal man 'likes' almost every woman he encounters.

[]

Flirting is to a woman what experimentation is to electricity.

In the School of Coquettes
Madame Rose is a scholar;—
Oh, they fish with all nets
In the School of Coquettes!
When her brooch she forgets
'Tis to show a new collar...

The stage is a woman's pedestal.

[]

If, in the presence of women with feminine pride, you accept insults gracefully... the proud beauties are irked. They take you for a weakling, and soon begin to insult you themselves. These haughty characters practically throw themselves into the arms of men who are thoroughly intolerant of others. This is, I think, the only line to take, so that you often have to pick a quarrel with your neighbor to avoid one with your mistress.

[]

Courtship is harder for men because they must show a proper blend of harmlessness and strength.

[]

A prerequisite of love is that a man's face, at first sight, should reveal something to be respected and something to be pitied.

[]

Complacency is in women as in beings of a lesser, perhaps, but finer and lighter species. What a delight to encounter creatures who have their heads always filled with dancing and whims and clothes! They are the charm of all over-tense and serious masculine souls, whose lives are filled with enormous responsibilities.

[]

As you are woman, so be lovely;
As you are lovely, so be various,
Merciful as constant, constant as various,
So be mine, as I yours forever.

[]

Woman is a miracle of divine contradictions.

[]

The core of the feminine mind, no matter how intelligent the woman may be, is occupied by an irrational power....The woman offers the man the magic opportunity of relating with another being without reasoning, of influencing, dominating, surrendering to another, without any reason entering into it.

[]

Why do you always sit at the window? No doubt it makes a pretty picture but a girl walking in the fields also makes a pretty picture...

[]

So bright the tear in Beauty's eye,
Love half regrets to kiss it dry.

[]

A man wasn't bored with that girl, that's for sure!

[]

The birds go to sleep by the sweet wild twist of her song.

[]

Some women, in fact in my experience many women, have a sort of "abstract" quality about them. ...Perhaps this quality is really just unselfishness.

[]

Of praises sung of her she is aware,
Yet clad in sweet humility she goes.

[]

Maidens' hearts are always soft...

[]

She was terrified, shy, shamefaced, and therefore all the more charming.

Men fall in love with deer, with what there is of the deer in a woman.

Ursula, in a garden, found
A bed of radishes.
She kneeled upon the ground
And gathered them,
With flowers around,
Blue, gold, pink, and green.

[]

O wild, dark flower of woman,
Deep rose of my desire,
An Eastern wizard made you
Of earth and stars and fire.

[]

There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
At every joint and motive of her body.

...she laughed gaily with that delightful, deep laughter which was one of her chief charms.

[]

...there was an excitement in her voice... a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour... [Her voice] was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it... High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl...

[]

And on the wing
Of her sweet voice, it shall appear
That Love can enter at the ear.

[]

...how should I avoid to be her slave
Whose subtle art invisibly can wreathe
My fetters of the very air I breathe?

[]

You can shine your shoes and wear a suit
You can comb your hair and look quite cute
You can wear a collar and a tie
But one thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside...

[]

...you
Shine like an early drop of dew
Poised on a red rose petal.

[]

Like the touch of rain she was
On a man's flesh and hair and eyes
When the joy of walking thus
Has taken him by surprise

[]

...she had the sparkle of a real diamond among paste.

[]

Thou art so very sweet and fair,
With such a heaven in thine eyes,
It almost seems an overcare
To ask thee to be good or wise.
As if a little bird were blam'd
Because its song unthinking flows;
As if a rose should be asham'd
Of being nothing but a rose.

I'm attracted to men who are ambivalent toward me.

She was so sad and serene, so sweet and yet so withdrawn, that Leon felt himself gripped by a kind of icy enchantment (charme glacial) in her presence, just as one shivers in a church when the fragrance of flowers is mingled with the coldness of marble.

[]

Because of that great nobleness of hers
The fire that stirs about her, when she stirs,
Burns but more clearly.

[]

...the sort of melancholy and the sort of mystery which make women feel for men pity, then quickly love.

[]

You have an elegant gait
competing with the chameleon.

She was a creature that did move more like the sphere
of Mars of Jove of Sol of Love or one more fair.

[]

...a perfect beauty,
she has no blemish;
especially when she is laughing,
I always wish she would laugh again.

[]

I came in as bright as a neon light
And I burned out right there before him...

Exuberance is Beauty.

She was not beautiful but it took her only about ten seconds to persuade people that she was.

[]

...practically none of his features could have been called beautiful by the standards of the sculptor or painter—what one noticed was beauty of another kind—the beauty of expression.

[]

If you would be loved, love and be lovable.

[]

At fifteen, I was able to compose my eyebrows...

[]

She is a beautiful stylish woman, the sort of woman you and I would never normally come within a hundred miles of...

[]

...only God, my dear,
Could love you for yourself alone
And not your yellow hair.

[]

Magic is tangled in a woman's hair
For the entanglement of male pride.

[]

Chain me, chain me, O most fair,
Chain me to thee with that hair!

[]

She opened her eyes, and green
They shone, clear like flowers undone
For the first time, now for the first time seen.

[]

Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee,
The shooting stars attend thee;
And the elves also,
Whose little eyes glow
Like the sparks of fire, befriend thee.

[]

The light that lies
In women's eyes,
Has been my heart's undoing.

[]

From women's eyes this doctrine I derive.
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain, and nourish all the world.

...two gentle puddinges Soft & white,

Pale hands I loved beside the Shalimar...

He looked like a statue that had been rubbed with honey and warm wax, to get a golden tone...

Nor Venus could more softnes showe
Should she put on hir Cloud ag'in.

[]

Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me.

[]

...one of the most instructive avenues for assessing human evolution would be to attempt a history of the feminine types which have successively been preferred.

[]

I found her slightly sluttish unkempt shabbiness physically attractive.

[]

Robes loosely flowing, hair as free:
Such sweet neglect more taketh me
Than all th'adulteries of art.

[]

Salome always looks for a man who is so different from other men that he seems almost to belong to an unknown sex.

[]

I can't abide men who aren't good-looking.

[]

The type of human being we prefer reveals the contours of our heart... By observing our neighbor in love we are able to deduce his vision or goal in life. And this is the most interesting thing to ascertain: not anecdotes about his existence, but the card upon which he stakes his life.

The ever-lit lamp of the evangelical virgins is the symbol of this virtue which constitutes, as it were, the threshold of love.

[]

Like a sailor in distress, she kept scanning the solitude of her life with anxious eyes, straining to sight some far-off white sail in the mists of the horizon.

[]

One feels desire before knowing the person or situation that satisfies it.

[]

Poor is the life that misses
The lover's greatest treasure,
Innumerable kisses
Which end in endless pleasure.
Oh, then, if this be so,
Shall I a virgin die? Fie no!

[]

...I then felt free to fall in love...

[]

He's just played the tyrant for too long. I must have new love.

[]

An absence of mistrust is not enough; there must be a weariness of mistrusting, and, as it were, courage must be impatient with the hazards of life. You are unconsciously bored by living without loving...

In the unattached heart of a girl who is living in a secluded chateau in the depths of the country, the least touch of surprise arouses profound interest.

[]

In Rome, where day-to-day events provide so little interest, and where outer existence is so lethargic, sensibility accumulates to the benefit of the passions.

[]

The heat of the sun on a summer day
Warms a young girl in an amorous way.

[]

For love to assume its full stature in the heart of man, it [is] necessary that the greatest possible equality should be established between the mistress and her lover.

[]

[Consider] the Benou-Azra, a tribe famous for love throughout all the tribes of Arabia. Their way of loving has become a byword, for God never made other creatures who loved so tenderly.

[]

In Italy, since passion is not infrequent it is not ridiculous and one hears generalizations about love freely quoted in drawing-rooms.

[]

There are many people who would never have been in love if they had never heard love spoken of.

[]

What she felt she could not find words to tell, for she was only a simple girl reared in the fields, and never in her life had ever heard the word: love.

[]

Yesterday evening I heard two delightful little girls of four singing some very lively love-songs as I pushed them in their swing. The chambermaids teach them these songs and their mother tells them that 'love' and 'lover' are meaningless words...

[]

Love's like the measles—all the worse when it comes late in life.

[]

We gotta get you a woman
It's like nothin else to make you
Feel sure you're alive!

An honest farmer was complaining of damage caused in his orchard and I asked him why he did not keep a dog. "My daughters would never marry," was his reply, which I did not understand until he told me that once he had a dog so fierce that none of the boys ever dared to climb through his windows.

[]

What did I know
thinking myself
able to go
alone all the way

[]

All who joy would win
Must share it—Happiness was born a twin.

[]

My room was white with the sun
And Love cried out in me,
"I am strong, I will break your heart
Unless you set me free."

[]

Prudishness is the worst kind of avarice.

[]

A charming woman may... treat a man now with extreme coldness, because she is saving herself for a future lover whom she may never even meet. ...It is as if an orange-tree dared not flower for fear of committing a sin.

[]

A great man is like an eagle; the higher he goes, the less you see of him, and loneliness is the price he pays for being great.

Behold, I too am brave; I too will not stop short of the ideal.

[]

...if somewhere there existed a strong, handsome man with a valorous, passionate and refined nature, a poet's soul in the form of an angel... why was it not possible that she might meet him some day?

[]

The majority of men... have little propensity for passionate love; it would disturb their delightful tranquility; I believe they would regard its transports as unhappiness; certainly they would be humiliated by its shyness.

[]

Little boy, pretty knave, shoot not at random,
For if you hit me, slave, I'll tell your grandam.

[]

I will humble my Beauty, I will not dress fine,
I will keep from the Ball, & my Eyes shall not shine;
And if any Girl's Lover forsakes her for me,
I'll refuse him my hand and from Envy be free.

[]

When is man strong until he feels alone?

[]

I think that every intensely personal life has always had to isolate a fictitious personality, a kind of dermato-psyche to hold off and distract the hostile curiosity of inferior people, in order to be able, behind that bulwark, to devote itself freely to being what it is.

[]

I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.

[]

Whilst I do keep
My harmless sheep
Love hath no power on me:
'Tis idle souls
Which he controls;
The busy man is free.

[]

Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
A long way from my home...

Insomnia, dark circles
poor resistance... disease.

[]

What a woman was there snatched by puritanism from love!


[]

Never even to have touched
The hot blood
Of a soft body,
Doesn't it make you unhappy
You who preach morality?

[]

Oh, is it not enough to be
Here with this beauty over me?
My throat should ache with praise, and I
Should kneel in joy beneath the sky.
...O beauty, are you not enough?
Why am I crying after love?

[]

My heart, being hungry, feeds on food
The fat of heart despise.
Beauty where beauty never stood,
And sweet where no sweet lies
I gather to my querulous need,
Having a growing heart to feed.

[]

'Passionate Love'
I wish to feel a love
Which might be likened to
Burying a hot cheek
In a soft drift of snow.

[]

...sixteen is an age which thirsts for love and is not excessively particular about what beverage chance may provide.


[]

I live all alone, and I am a young girl.
I write long letters and I do not know
anyone to send them to.
Most tender things speak in my heart
And I can only say them to the bamboos in the garden...

[]

Let those love now who never loved before,
Let those who always loved, now love the more.

[]

O Morning Winds that from the garden blow,
Should you meet one like me forlorn and sad,
On him bestow
The peace and solace I have never had.

[]

For this will cure him that is sick, and raise him that is in dumps; one that has loved, it will remember of it; one that has not, it will instruct...

Timeless magic first began
When woman bared her soul to man.

If this be error, and upon me prov'd,
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.
